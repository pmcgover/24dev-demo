According to Krüssmann (1984), this was a hybrid of S. eriocephala Michx. × S. petiolaris Sm. (as S. cordata Muhl. × S. gracilis Andersson), developed in the US and commonly used in forestry and basketry. Rehder proposed that this was a hybrid of S. purpurea L., with a long history of cultivation in the US for basketry, and S. eriocephala Michx. (as S. rigida Muhl.). But Bean (1981) mentioned that this cultivar is now considered to be S. eriocephala Michx. × S. petiolaris Sm. (as S. gracilis Andersson). He stated that this is a male cultivar, probably a hybrid of S. eriocephala Michx. (as S. rigida Muhl.), introduced from the US to Germany by basket maker Ernst Hoedt and propagated by Otto Schon’s nursery, which distributed three million cuttings of this cultivar as S. americana Hort. ex Schwerin, not Anderss, in 1914 (Bean, 1981). According to M. Dodge (pers. comm., August 2015), this cultivar is very popular among basketmakers in Europe, but has not been available in North America for perhaps a century. Ernst Hoedt, a willow basketry master, illegally imported this clone to Poland from the US after his stay in the US. When the American customs authorities objected to the transit, Hoedt created baskets woven from fresh willow twigs, which he later planted in the Trzciel nursery at the Nowy Tomyśl area of Poland. The new plant known as "the Trzciel American", spread around Europe and nowadays is considered among the best for wickerwork goods.

Santamour and McArdle considered trees at the US National Arboretum (accession NA44011) to be typical for this cultivar. According to Santamour and McArdle, it was likely that this cultivar had been introduced at various points along the ancient trade routes through southern Asia to the Near East, and to Europe around 1730.  It was originally introduced to England during 1748 by Mr. Vernon, and a few trees of this clone still survive near Twickenham. Because of its limited frost hardiness, it has almost disappeared from the UK; however, as one of the parents of S. ×pendulina f. salamonii I.V.Belyaeva (as S. ×sepulcralis Simonk.), this subtropical clone provided significant heat tolerance to its cultivar ‘Chrysocoma’ (http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/salix-x-sepulcralis-golden-weeping-willow; accessed 10 December 2014). ‘Babylon’ was depicted in willow-pattern crockery.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	‘Babylon’ was the preferred name in the LNWP 2016–2020.  	\N	\N

Bean (1981) described this cultivar as a vigorous male plant with polished orange-yellow stems. Leaves are finely serrated, glabrous, bright-green. Catkins are drooping, 6–10 cm long, appearing with the leaves. When it is pruned in spring, its stem color is even brighter than that of S. ×fragilis f. vitellina (L.) I.V. Belyaeva. This cultivar was selected by the basket maker and willow grower William Scaling of Basford, Nottinghamshire, UK, during the 1860s, named S. basfordiana Scaling ex S.J.Salter, and described under the same name by James Salter in 1882 (Salter, 1882). According to Meikle (1984), there are male and female clones of this cultivar. It can be distinguished from ‘Vitellina’, with which it is often confused, by its lustrous leaves and long pendulous catkins. Krüssmann (1984) listed it as S. × ‘Basfordiana’ and stated that this cultivar is a descendant of S. ×rubens  Schrank, which was discovered in the Arden district of England around 1863. It is widely planted today as a basket selection with stems yellow at the base, orange in the middle and bright red at the tips (Stott, 2001). 	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	‘Basfordiana’ was the preferred name in the LNWP 2016–2020 for a cultivar of S. ×rubens Schrank and the accepted name for a male cultivar in the 2018 RHS HD.

One of the most widely sold weeping willows, especially in North America where it is known as the “Thurlow weeping willow” and often listed as S. babylonica L. or ‘Tristis’. According to Chmelar (1983), this is an old artificial cross originating in Germany about 1831. The branches are grey-green; branchlets are brittle and pendulous down to the ground. Chmelar described it as a female clone with rough bark and “horny-tipped” buds; the leaves, which have well-developed stipules, shed early in autumn. It was described by Andersson in 1867 as a specimen collected in a garden in Hessen, Germany, and later introduced into commerce by Späth of Berlin (Bean, 1981). The appellation to the common name of S. ´pendulina var. blanda in the American trade as “Wisconsin weeping willow” might indicate that the plant was hardy in that state. This cultivar may encompass several clones.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	‘Blanda’ was the preferred name in the LNWP 2016–2020.  	‘Blanda’ was sold by three North American nurseries as S. ‘Wisconsin’ (2018 PIO). 	\N

According to Alastair Hesseltine, a basket maker and sculptor from British Columbia, Canada,  this was not a hybrid, but rather a selection of S. purpurea from the National School of Wicker-Growing and Basket-making at Fayl-Billot, France, which became very popular with French basket makers (M. Dodge; pers. comm., Oct. 2015).  Hesseltine gave it another name ‘Purple Dicks’, which should be considered as a synonym. 	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Not established	\N	\N	\N

Leaves are suborbicular, densely pubescent above with grey-tomentose undersides and prominent venation. Catkins appear with or before the leaves. It occurs on rock-ledges at high attitudes (Meikle, 1975). B. Floderus suggested that this may be a form of S. lapponum L. (Meikle, 1975). According to Bean (1981), it was found around 1900 in the mountains of Scotland by W. Boyd, who raised many well-known alpine garden plants. It was described in 1913 by the Rev. E.F. Linton. It was E.F. Linton who suggested that this was a hybrid of S. lapponum and S. reticulata L., while admitting that this suggestion was not fully satisfactory. Bean remarked that this was a unique plant with female catkins very similar to S. lapponum and foliage similar to S. reticulata. However, Bean also mentioned that some additional characters—the short petioles and short, round glabrescent buds—indicate that S. herbacea L. may also be remotely involved. Listed by Krüssmann (1984) as S. boydii (S. lanata L. × S. reticulata), a low-growing shrub 0.5–0.7 m tall with short, outspread branches and almost circular, 1–1.25 cm long leaves. However, the progeny of a cross of S. ‘Boydii’ as mother and S. lapponum L. as father has most characters of S. lapponum, but not of S. lanata, as Krüssmann suggested (T.

A very attractive cultivar, which represents a mutation with a short trunk and dense spherical crown that appears to be trimmed (Skvortsov, 1968, 1999). Interestingly, its branchlets are all of thesame length and form very dense clusters which do not detach easily, unlike S. ×fragilis L. branchlets, which are loose, very fragile and more easily damaged by wind (T. Uronen, pers. comm., July 2015). It has been grown in the Baltic Countries since the late 18 century. The first documented record of this cultivar is a photograph of a 50-year-old tree without a description or a name, taken by Carl Buettner in Kurland (currently Latvia)  and published in Mitteilungen der Deutschen Dendrologischen Gessellschaft in 1915 (Kolkka, 2002). According to Skvortsov (1968, 1999), this cultivar was popular in Lithuania and was occasionally found in Poland, Latvia, and around St. Petersburg, Russia. It was also widespread in Finland and Sweden (Kolkka, 2002). According to Shaburov (1977), it was found only in cultivation and only male specimens were known.  Due to its relatively low height, this cultivar is a promising street tree that can be planted under utility wires. Shaburov provided recommendations on how to grow it in the nursery to get a tree with a well-developed trunk suitable for street planting rather than a multistemmed shrub-type specimen. According to Krüssmann (1984), who listed it as S. fragilis L. ‘Bullata’, this cultivar has a compact globose habit up to 6 m tall and 9 m wide. He stated that it originated in Sweden around 1785. However, Kolkka (2002) noted that based on its current distribution, this cultivar originated rather in Latvia or a nearby area. ‘Bullata’ was the preferred name in the LNWP 2016–2020 as S. ×fragilis L. ‘Bullata’. Salix fragilis var. bullata was listed as the accepted name in the 2018 RHS HD. ‘Bullata’ was sold by two North American nurseries (2018 PIO) and was found in trade in the Netherlands (2018 PS). ‘Bullata’ was most recently sold by one UK nursery in 2006 (2013 RHS PF).

Shoots are red-brown on the upper side at the apex. Leaves are 9.5 cm long and 1.5 cm wide; glossy green above with a somewhat grey underside. They have silky pubescence in spring, later becoming glabrous on the undersides, often with brown margins. Red petioles are 7 mm long. Ovaries are somewhat stalked. The original tree was found around 1700 in Norfolk, England. It was used in England for cricket bats, hence its common name, “cricket-bat willow” (Broekhuizen and Schneider, 1969; Krüssmann, 1984). According to Warren-Wren (1972), only female trees of this cultivar produce lumber of the required standard for cricket bats. According to Bean (1981), ‘Caerulea’ is a female clone sometimes called “blue willow” because its leaves have blue-grey undersides. Meikle (1984) noted that both sexes occur, although the male with less desirable quality for bats is less frequently planted.

Schaburov and  I.V. Belyaeva at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia (Belyaeva et al., 2000). The type specimen is 13.5 m tall with a trunk diameter 79 cm at the age of 45 years (Marchenko, 2017). This cultivar was grouped by Marchenko (2017) with others Schaburov’s cultivars: ‘Schater 1’, ‘Valentina Tereshkova’ and ‘Scharovidnii Karlik’, under the heading “Shaburov’s willow hybrids with green bark and pendulous branches”, where “pendulous” means less drooping than in weeping cultivars.  ‘Fantasia’ has a robust trunk. Its fine-textured broad oval crown is formed by very thin branches deviating from larger stems.  Medium-sized sickle-shaped leaves form a lacey crown. Marchenko (2017) described that it resembles „greenish foggy balloons floating and tangled within the crooked stems of the tree”. Leaves are light green above with grayish undersides. It has male, female and androgynous catkins, but the flowering is not very spectacular whe compare to other cultivars because of the high proportion of female flowers. Seed production is minimal and there is no problem with wind-blown “cotton” during springtime. This cultivar can be planted as a specimen in small or large gardens.  Foliage is susceptible to fungal diseases, which is noticeable only at close range. Tip blight can be a problem during humid summers, or mites may infect this plant during drought.  	V.I.

It had been sold for four years prior to this date. Santamour and McArdle (1988) mistakenly listed this cultivar as a “golden-leaved” willow.

It has slightly tortuous semi-pendulous branches and somewhat curled leaves; most often a shrub, though it can be a small tree (Dirr 2009). Dirr suggested that it should be correctly listed as S. ‘Erythroflexuosa’. According to M. Dodge (pers. comm. 2015), the stems of this cultivar are very contorted, not just “slightly” tortuous, and this selection is different from S. ‘Erythroflexuosa’ because its stems are not as red; it is also more weeping than other willows with contorted stems.

A mature tree can reach 18 m in height with a crown diameter of 8.5 m. This cultivar was developed at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia, by V.I. Shaburov (listed as S. alba subsp. vitellina (L.) Schubl. & G.Martens × S. alba L. by Marchenko (2017) and later named by A.M. Marchenko. S. ‘Lyubimecz’ resembles S. ‘Pamyati Bazhova’ but has a smaller trunk diameter and more compact crown. It develops a weeping habit by the age of seven years; in younger plants crowns are pyramidal. Flowering is more spectacular than in S. ‘Pamyati Bazhova’ because of its larger catkins and flower bracts.  ‘Lyubimecz’ is one of a few clones from the same hybrid combination along with S. ‘Oranzhevaya Tolstostvol’naya’, S. ‘Oranzhevaya Tonkostvol’naya’ and S. ‘Strela Kupidona’. These cultivars were described by Marchenko (2017) under the heading “Shaburov’s willow hybrids with yellow-orange bark and a late weeping habit.” They have very bright branches and branchlets, which are very dense (the densest, compared to other Shaburov hybrids). These cultivars have a distinctive appearance when their habit changes with age: when young, they have an upright, narrow pyramidal crown, which later becomes broadly oval and slightly weeping and, by the age of about nine years, the weeping crown is more pronounced. The late weeping habit and extreme cold hardiness are inherited from the male parent, S. alba from the Urals. The summer foliage has an attractive bluish green color. There are both, male (S. ‘Lyubimecz’ and S. ‘Strela Kupidona’) and female (S. ‘Oranzhevaya Tolstostvol’naya’ and S. ‘Oranzhevaya Tonkostvol’naya’) clones listed in this cross. The flowering of the male cultivars is profuse and spectacular. S. ‘Lyubimets’, S. ‘Oranzhevaya Tonkostvol’naya’ and S. ‘Strela Kupidona’ have thinner stems than S. ‘Oranzhevaya Tolstostvol’naya’.

One of its parents is S. ledebouriana Trautv. f. kuraica Liss. while another parent is described by the authors as a hybrid of S. purpurea L.  This cultivar was selected for basket weaving. Marchenko (2017) described it as a very ornamental plant and listed it under the trade designation FEJERVERK, which translates from Russian language as “Fireworks“. When ‘Mayak-2’ is left unpruned it resembles S. purpurea  ‘Nana’, but it is brighter, more cold hardy and does not break easily under heavy snow. It is a very fast growing shrub: the new growth can reach 2 m in three weeks during spring. Its straight unbranched stems gracefully move with the wind or bend during rain. Marchenko recommends planting 10-15 cuttings or plugs into one planting hole to achieve a dense spherical crown which can reach 3 m diameter after 7 years. For a fountain shape, it should be coppiced every spring 1-1.5 cm above the previous year stumps following the simespherical pattern.	\N	\N	\N	Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia 	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	\N	\N	\N

Krüssmann listed it as S. ×moorei H.C.Watson ex B.White (S. herbacea L. × S. myrsinifolia Salisb.) while S. ×grahamii Borrer listed it as a different species with the same parentage (S. herbacea × S. myrsinifolia). It is likely that Krüssmann attempted to follow White (1890) who listed S. ×moorei as S. herbacea × S. myrsinifolia and S. ×grahamii Borrer ex Baker as S. herbacea L. × S. phylicifolia. E.F. Linton considered S. ×grahamii Borrer to be a hybrid of S. herbacea × S. myrsinites L. According to Meikle (1985), this cultivar was very similar to S. ×grahamii, but with longer narrower bracts, thinly or occasionally densely pilose ovaries and glabrous pedicels. It was discovered by Dr. David Moore on the top of Muckish Mountain, Donegal County, Ireland, in 1866 and introduced to the Glasvevin Botanic Garden from which it was further distributed.  Following Bean (1981), Meikle noted that without doubt it has the same parentage as S. ×grahamii (as S. aurita L. × S. herbacea × S. repens L. (Meikle, 1984)) and should be considered to be its variety. Meikle noted that since S. myrsinites, S. phylicifolia and S. myrsinifolia are not recorded for Ireland or are very rare there, he prefers to equate S. ×grahamii and S. ×moorei and list them as hybrids of S. aurita × S. herbacea ×S. repens. 	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	Listed as an unresolved name in The Plant List (http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=salix; accessed 10 December 2014). ‘Moorei’ was the preferred name in the LNWP 2016–2020 and the accepted name for a female cultivar in 2018 RHS HD. 	‘Moorei’ was found in trade in the Netherlands (2018 PS).

Forestfarm Nursery obtained this cultivar from Mr. Schwind, an Azalea breeder from Georgia, US. The cultivar was also introduced into US from Rein en Mark Bulk (Boskoop, Holland) through Spring Meadow Nursery (Michigan, US). Mark Bulk (Boskoop, Holland) was given the plant by a French man Guy Maillot who often traveled to Japan and brought this plant back from one of his trips (Mark Bulk, pers. comm., Feb. 2017). The name on the label was S.·×leucopithecia  ‘Pink Nekko Yanagi’, but the name was changed to S. chaenomeloides  ‘Mount Aso’ (Mark Bulk, pers. comm., Feb. 2017). It was named after the largest volcano in Japan, Mount Aso. As with ‘Mt. Asama’, Shu Suehiro noted that this cultivar is not known in Japan (S. Suehiro, personal comm., Oct. 2015). Its branches can be used for Valentine’s Day as an alternative to red roses (Vermont Willow Nursery, Vermont, US, 2014 on-line catalog). According to Dirr (2009), a cultivar with abundant gray-white ‘‘caterpillar-like’’ catkins. The description is not quite accurate as only old inflorescences turn into ‘‘long gray caterpillars”. This epithet is often listed erroneously as a cultivar of S. chaenomeloides Kimura but is in fact S. gracilistyla Miq. (Kuzovkina et al., 2016a). Later, M.

Bean discussed the confusion between ‘Gracilis' (the botanical variety f. gracilis (Grenier & Godron) Schneid., which has a decumbent habit that should be considered as part of the normal variation of S. purpurea L.) and ‘Nana’, which should be distinguished as a horticultural cultivar. It was listed by Krüssmann (1984) as ‘Gracilis’ (syn. S. purpurea var. nana Dieck and S. purpurea var. uralensis Späth). According to Krüssmann, this was a dwarf, finely branched female form with narrow leaves, useful for weaving and small hedges; selected around 1900. Often called “arctic blue leaf willow” in the US (Dirr, 2009), although it does not occur in the arctic zone. The native distribution of this species includes Northern Africa and Europe and as its range extends north to only the USDA hardiness zone 3.

It tolerates industrial environments well and is used in urban landscaping in Perm, Russia. ‘Oranzhevaya Tonkostvol’naya’ was developed at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia, by V.I. Shaburov in 1960, and later was named by A.M. Marchenko (Marchenko, 2017). This was one of a few clones from the same cross of S. ×fragilis f. vitellina × S. alba L. (listed as S. alba subsp. vitellina (L.) Schubl. & G.Martens × S. alba L. by Marchenko, 2017). The description of these willows is provided under S. ‘Lyubimecz’. 	V.I. Shaburov 	A.M.

Bark on older stems is shallowly grooved and gray, while on purple-stemmed selections of S. daphnoides Vill. it is almost black.  It is very cold hardy. According to T.Uronen, it was found in an old basket plantation near Oritkari (north of Oulu, Finland), and was likely of Scandinavian origin (pers. comm., March 2018). ‘Oritkari’ benefits from regular coppicing as it forms a rather shapeless shrub; when an older specimen is cut down it will not respourt as vigorously as other willows.  ‘Oritkari’ was listed by Uronen (2005; 2015; http://www.pajutjapoppelit.com; accessed 13 September 2015).	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	\N	\N	\N

This cultivar, along with ‘The Lemley’, was listed by Hubbard (1904) and Lamb (1914), where both selections were highly recommended for basket production due to their low susceptibility to pests and diseases. Hubbard (1904) called both cultivars “Caspian willow (Salix pruinosa acutifolia and variations of the same)”, while Lamb (1914) called ‘Patent Lemley’ as “S. pentandra major” and ‘The Lemley’ as “S. pentandra minor”. These cultivars grow best on sandy soils; when grown in heavy clay, the soil should be deeply plowed, and lime should be applied when grown in acid soil (Lamb, 1914). Both cultivars are branched at the base, especially when grown under wide spacing; it is advisable to remove these lateral branches to obtain better rods. The branches of both cultivars, especially ‘The Lemley’, tend to curve at the base and when harvested require special preparation and bundling for manufacturers (Lamb, 1914). The English author P. Ellmore (1915) who lists them as ‘Patent Lumley’ and ‘Lumley’, notes that along with S. triandra L. ‘American Green’, both cultivars were sent to him by the US Forestry Department in 1910 with a comment that these cultivars are the best suited for transatlantic climatic conditions. It was reported that they grew 1.2-1.8 m during a very dry season in 1911 and escaped infestation of green fly, which affected the other varieties during that year. The 2018 online catalog of the Vermont Willow Nursery, Vermont, US, notes that this female cultivar has the most attractive foliage of all willows. It lists it as a cultivar of S. ×meyeriana Rostk. ex Willd. with the comment that this cultivar has fragile branchlets. This listing was based upon Zinovjev’s publication (2011) stating that the majority of plants in North America are likely to be selections of  S. ×meyeriana , as S. ×pentandra L. as branchlets are not brittle. Another suggestion is that this cultivar should probably be listed as a hybrid of S. ×pentandra × S. lucida Muhl. (M. Dodge, pers. comm., Feb. 2018). 	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	‘Patent Lemley’ was the accepted name in the 2018 RHS HD. 	‘Patent Lemley’ was sold by one UK nursery (2018 RHS PF).	\N

It is common in cultivation in northern China (Bean, 1981).  It is likely that a few clones were cultivated under this name during the 1900s. A pendulous male clone was introduced to the Arnold Arboretum by F.N. Meyer in 1908. Female plants with silky ovaries and green young bark cultivated in the UK were probably introduced by J. Hers during the 1920s along with ‘Tortuosa’ (Bean, 1981). Santamour and McArdle (1988) suggested that since the name “pendula” has been applied to so many weeping willows, its meaning has lost any significance. However, they suggested that it “might be considered as a valid name for the female clone if its identity can be verified”. 	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	‘Pendula’ was the preferred name in the LNWP 2016–2020 and the accepted name for a cultivar of S. babylonica var. pekinensis in the 2018 RHS HD. Note: Because this cultivar name in the Latin form was established before 1 January 1959 and has been repeated within the denomination class Salix, but with different species, this epithet must be linked to the name of the species to which it applies (ICNCP, 2016, Art. 21.7).   	‘Pendula’ was sold by two North American nurseries (2018 PIO), one UK nursery (2018 RHS PF) and was found in trade in the Netherlands (2018 PS).	\N

The original tree died around 1884 (Elwes and Henry, 1913). According to Späth (1930), S. caprea var. pendula T.Lang was a female cultivar. However, the sex of weeping goat willows was the source of confusion while both clones—male and female—were frequently cultivated under the name S. caprea ‘Pendula’. This problem was discussed by Lancaster (1976), who stated that a male weeping clone was sold in Holland and Germany, while a female weeping clone was common in British gardens. Lancaster proposed to name a male cultivar of weeping goat willow ‘Kilmarnock’ and the female clone ‘Weeping Sally’.  Chmelar (1983) stated that in addition to ‘Kilmarnock’, there was a new staminate clone, the result of crossing a female pendulous S. caprea L. and S. ×erdingeri A.Kern. (S. caprea × S. daphnoides Vill.) backcrossed to pendulous S. caprea. This clone is highly attractive and produces numerous yellow catkins which appear before leaves. S. caprea ‘Pendula’ was listed as a synonym of S. caprea ‘Kilmarnock’ in the 2018 RHS HD.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	 Since ‘Pendula’ is the earliest name in accordance with the Rules of the ICNCP, 2016 (Principle 3), it is practical to designate ‘Pendula’ as the accepted name for a male cultivar, and a later synonym ‘Kilmarnock’, as a trade name. Because this cultivar name in the Latin form was established before 1 January 1959 and has been repeated within the denomination class Salix, but with different species, the epithet must be linked to the name of the species to which it applies (ICNCP, 2016, Art. 21.7). 	‘Pendula’ was sold by two North American nurseries (2018 PIO) and 32 UK nurseries (2014 RHS PF). ‘Kilmarnock’ was found in trade in the Netherlands (2018 PS).	\N

Schaburov and  I.V. Belyaeva at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia (Belyaeva et al., 1998). It is a low-growing, green-barked weeping tree selected for the Urals, a region with a short growing season and cold winters. ‘Plakuschij Gnom’ is 1.7 m tall, with a trunk 60 mm diameter and a strongly weeping crown up to 1.5 m in diameter. Branchlets are slender, long, touching the ground, yellow-brown, glabrous or slightly pubescent. Flower buds are similar to the vegetative buds. Leaves are small, 40–60 mm long and 6–12 mm wide, pubescent on both sides. ‘Plakuschij Gnom’ does not flower, according to Belyaeva et al. (1998). According to Marchenko (2017) it can reach 6-7 m height, 0.2 m trunk diameter and 5 m crown diameter at the age of 10 years. This is one of a few clones from the same hybrid combination along with ‘Sverdlovskaja Plakutschaja’, ‘Ideal’, ‘Pamyati Mindovskogo’ and ‘Podarok Sud`by`’. ‘Plakuschij Gnom’ was grouped by Marchenko (2017) with other Schaburov’s cultivars ‘Podarok Sud`by`’, ‘Sverdlovskaja Plakutschaja’ and ‘Vodopad’, under the heading “ Shaburov’s willow hybrids with green bark and a weeping habit”. Its trunk is densely branched from ground level at an early age. Main branches deviate from the trunk at a 45° angle, and often are as long as the main trunk. Timely pruning can shape the crown to form a very attractive small weeping tree. If the lower branches are not pruned, the tree can become multi-stemmed. Sometimes the trunk can arch at the top, and a few side branches develop into leaders making the plant multi-stemmed at a height of 1.5-2 m. Branchlets are olive-green color in summer, becoming glossy and brown, often with purplish coloration, in winter. Leaves are green above with glaucous undersides, narrow lanceolate with attenuate tip.  Flowering is ornamental because the majority of catkins are male or androgynous. Most male catkins are located in the middle of the crown, while female catkins are positioned closer to the upper portion. Seed production is minimal and there is no problem with wind- blown “cotton” in the air during springtime. ‘Plakuschij Gnom’ is a valuable ornamental tree because it is the lowest weeping willow hardy in northern climates.  It is suitable for small gardens and is especially attractive when planted near small ponds. 	V.I. Schaburov and  I.V.

This is one of a few clones from the same hybrid combination along with ‘Plakutschii Gnom’, ‘Sverdlovskaja Plakuchaya’, ‘Ideal’ and ‘Pamyati Mindovskogo’.  This cultivar was grouped by Marchenko (2017) with other Schaburov’s cultivars ‘Plakuschij Gnom’, ‘Sverdlovskaja Plakutschaja’ and ‘Vodopad’, under the heading “Shaburov’s willow hybrids with green bark and a weeping habit”. It is a green-barked weeping tree with a broad oval crown reaching 12 m height and 1 m trunk diameter at the age of 45 years. Its main branches deviate from the trunk at right angles forming sinusoid lines. From these lines the secondary branches of weeping habit produce curtains 5-7 m long, hanging at a distance from the trunk. These curtains produce elegant cascades, which form the beautiful crown of the tree. Foliage is very graceful with the greatest ratio of their length to width at about 7.5:1. Foliage is green above with glaucous undersides, which makes leaves appear bicolored at a distance even on a calm day. Catkins are mostly androgynous; some flowers are also androgynous and abnormal (with some aberrations). ‘Podarok Sud`by`’ is a very ornamental weeping willow for cold climates, and has the longest weeping stems of all Shaburov’s weeping hybrids (Marchenko, 2017). ‘Podarok Sud`by`’ is suitable for large and medium size gardens.

It is hardy in the USDA Zones 3–7.  According to Wandell (1989), this cultivar was introduced by Morden Experimental Station, Canada, during 1981. According to Dirr (2009), this is a hybrid between S. pendandra L. and S. ×pendulina Wender. ‘Blanda’ with glossy green foliage of S. pendandra   and the weeping habit, stem color, and golden winter bark of ‘Blanda’. According to T. Uronen (pers. comm., July 2015), this cultivar is rather a hybrid of S. ×pendulina f. salamonii I.V. Belyaeva (as S. ×salamonii (Carrière) Carrière). S. ×pendulina f. salamonii   ‘Chrysocoma’ has golden stems as S. ‘Prairie Cascade’.  The second parent, according to Uronen, is rather Salix ×meyeriana Rostk. ex Willd. (S. euxina I.V.Belyaeva × S. pentandra L.) than S. pendandra L. because S. ‘Prairie Cascade’ sets seeds in mid-summer, but not in late-summer or autumn as hybrids of S. pentandra. Also, S. ×meyeriana Rostk. ex Willd. is the more likely parent because this hybrid species was often cultivated in the US, but S. pendandra L. is very rarely found in cultivation (http://www.salicicola.com/notes/salix_x_meyeriana/forgotten_willow.html; accessed  28 September 2018).

The lumps are noticeable many months before anthesis as protrusions of the generative bud scales. They attract attention when catkins form during the preceding year during late July–August, remaining visible during wintertime until the developing structures push off the bud scales and lumpy gray catkins appear. Flowers develop normally. A cross section of the bud reveals a branched axis of the catkin. ‘Rabbit’s Foot’ has long-lasting ornamental value in winter and springtime. Its catkins are very decorative and are frequently used for floral cut-stems. Originally, plants of ‘Rabbit’s Foot’ were procured in 1999 from Klyn Nursery, Ohio, US, as S. chaenomeloides Kimura. In the catalog of Klyn Nursery, its catkins were described as ‘‘the size of a rabbit’s foot‘‘. Therefore, the cultivar was named ‘Rabbit’s Foot’ because of the resemblance of a rabbit’s foot by the virtue of size and structure of the catkins. Verification of this clone in March 2016 confirmed its identity with the U.S. National Arboretum accession NA 57189, which was introduced to US from Fujinami Nursery, Japan in 1985. As with ‘Winter Glory’, this cultivar was also proposed to be a hybrid of S.·×leucopithecia Kimura. Salix·×leucopithecia is thought to have been cultivated in Japan (Walters et al., 1989), and probably, these selections originated in Japan as well.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	\N	\N	\N

Bean (1981) considered this cultivar one of the most handsome and vigorous of all willows. It appeared on the property of Baron de Salamon at Manosque, France, before 1864 and was put into commerce in that country by Simon-Louis of Metz in 1869. This cultivar is less weeping than S. babylonica L., and it forms a broad head of branches. Leaves are first pubescent, later becoming glabrous, remaining on the tree until December. Flowers are mostly female and occasionally androgynous. Bean mentioned that older weeping willows, including this cultivar, became uncommon when S. ‘Chrysocoma’ began to spread at the end of the 19th century. Bean considers S. ‘Salamonii’ synonymous with S. ‘Sepulcralis’. Santamour and McArdle (1988) quoted Elwes and Henry (1913) as saying that the young plants (only female trees were known) develop pyramidal crowns with only the tips of the branches pendulous.

Schaburov and  I.V. Belyaeva at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia (Belyaeva et al., 1998). It is a cold-hardy, low-growing shrub with a pendulous crown selected for the Urals, a region with a short growing season and cold winters. This cultivar is 1.5 m tall, with a trunk 85 mm in diameter and a crown diameter up to 1.2 m. Two-year-old stems are thin, yellow/brown, and partially pubescent. Branchlets are short, slender, and reddish at the base. Flower buds are similar to vegetative buds, reddish-brown, elongated, 4–5 mm long and 1.5–2.5 mm wide. Leaves are small, 50–60 mm long and 6–10 mm wide, slightly pubescent, with small (0.5 mm long) stipules. ‘Scharovidnii Karlik’ does not flower (Belyaeva et al., 1998). This cultivar was grouped by Marchenko (2017) with other Schaburov’s cultivars ‘Schater 1’, ‘Fantasia’, and ‘Valentina Tereshkova’, under the heading “ Shaburov’s willow hybrids with green bark and pendulous branches”, where “pendulous” means less drooping than in weeping cultivars. According to Marchenko (2017) this is the most prominent ornamental cultivar developed by Schaburov. It can be quite large: the type specimen is 4.3 m high and 0.3 m in trunk diameter. Another plant, which was planted in one of the parks in Moscow more than 15 years ago is 4.5 m tall and has 4.3 m crown diameter. It does not flower every year, but when it does, the majority of catkins are male.  Foliage is susceptible to fungal diseases, and mites also occasionally infest this plant during drought. ‘Scharovidnii Karlik’ can be pruned into various crown shapes, making interesting “bonsai” type trees.

This cultivar is lower than ‘Schater 1’ and more disease resistant. Its cuttings take root more easily than ‘Schater 1’ (Belyaeva et al., 1999). This is a slow-growing multi-stemmed cultivar with an interesting marquee crown formed by very dense peripheral branches sheltering a void inside the crown (Marchenko, 2017). This cultivar was grouped by Marchenko with other Schaburov’s cultivars ‘Fantasia’, ‘Valentina Tereshkova’ and ‘Scharovidnii Karlik’ under the heading “ Shaburov’s willow hybrids with green bark and pendulous branches”, where “pendulous” means less drooping than in weeping cultivars. This cultivar is less ornamental than the other hybrids developed by Schaburov, but a type tree, which reaches 10 m height with crown diameter 14 m, is very attractive. According to Marchenko, who describes it under a trade designation SHATER, the parents of this cultivar are  S. alba subsp. vitellina (L.)Schubl. & G. Martens) × (S. babylonica L. × S. alba L.) He notes that the bright orange buds, which are very prominent and ornamental in winter, are likely inherited from S. alba subsp. vitellina. These buds give the crown an orange appearance, even though the stem bark is green.  Catkins are androgynous; the majority of them are male and attractive.

Belyaeva at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia (Belyaeva et al., 2000). This cultivar has a pyramidal crown and long narrow pendulous leaves. It is resistant to industrial pollution. According to Marchenko (2017) the female parent of ‘Permyachka’ was pollinated by a mix of pollen collected from the specimens of S. schwerinii from Perm, the northern part of Lake Baikal and Amur region, which was mixed with S. udensis. A plant with improved cold hardiness was selected from this group of seedlings. This narrow pyramidal cultivar seldom reaches 8 m in height. Its few stems have a sprawling base even at young age.  Branches are almost glabrous and greenish with brown-red spots in summer, becoming olive or brownish in winter.  Older stems are more brownish. ‘Schwerina Ulutschennaja’ has the longest leaves of all willows (and probably of all temperate trees), which can reach 32 cm on coppiced plants. They are bi-colored, dark green above with silver gray undersides, which is very noticeable during windy conditions.  In fall bright yellow coloration of its foliage is followed by an early leaf drop, which starts around mid-September. Its catkins break and release bud scales at the beginning of winter, but flowering starts in early springtime. In the Moscow region, catkins may frequently dry out during winter thaw (melt down) periods before anthesis but in the Yekaterinburg and Tumen regions they flower and produce seeds annually. Even dry catkins are very attractive and resemble numerous small white beads. ‘Schwerina Ulutschennaja’ is suitable for alley plantings, as specimens, or in Japanese gardens where it can be trained to imitate bamboo (Marchenko, 2017).

Its branch tips are usually fasciated up to 5 cm wide (Krüssmann, 1984). According to Smith et al. (1978), the most vigorous shoots are fascinated; less vigorous shoots remain normal. Its dry stems glisten with a rich mahogany brown color. The correct spelling of the epithet is ‘Sekka’, meaning fasciation in Japanese, not ‘Setsuka’, the name under which this cultivar was sold in the Netherlands. The term “sekka” or “sekika” (fasciation) is a compound of “seki” (stone) and “ka” (change or turn into). When these two words are united, the “i” is usually omitted (comment by Meyer (1962) based on pers. comm. with Dr. Ohwi). This cultivar was well known in trade as “fantail willow”, and was one of the most unusual willows, according to Bean (1981). It was frequently cultivated in Japan, and often found in the wild. This cultivar was introduced into Western cultivation by Jan Spek, Boskoop, Holland, in 1950. It is most attractive in spring before the leaves unfold, when its fasciated branches, densely covered with catkins, are not concealed. 	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	‘Sekka’ was the preferred name in the LNWP 2016–2020 and the accepted name for a male cultivar in the 2018 RHS HD. 	‘Sekka’ was sold by five North American (2018 PIO), four UK nurseries (2018 RHS PF) and was found in trade in the Netherlands (2018 PS). 	\N

It was described as a dwarf selection with small silver leaves and “dramatic” yellow winter buds and twigs (2018 online catalog of the Iseli Nursery, Oregon, US). ‘Silver Fox’ develops a sculpted habit with age and provides year-round interest with felt covered foliage during the growing season and contrasting buds and stems during dormant months (2018 online catalog of the Broken Arrow Nursery, Connecticut, US). 	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Not established	\N	\N	\N

Herman from North Dakota State University, US. It tolerates alkaline soil. ‘Silver Lake’ originated from a farm near Brinsmade, North Dakota, where the plant thrived nearly a century. This cultivar reaches 10–12 m in 18–25 years. It is recommended for shelters, shade, parks and as a specimen tree based upon 13 years of evaluation across the state of North Dakota (http://www.ndsuresearchfoundation.org/prairie reflection; accessed 28 September 2018). This tree was introduced as a cultivar of S. pentandra L., but was listed as as a cultivar of S. ×meyeriana Rostk. ex Willd. in the 2018 online catalog of the Vermont Willow Nursery, Vermont, US, with the comment that this cultivar has fragile branchlets. This listing was based upon A. Zinovjev’s publication (2011) stating that the majority of plants in North America are likely to be selections of S. ×meyeriana Rostk. ex Willd., as S. ×pentandra branchlets are not brittle. This is an excellent selection, which makes effective screens (2018 online catalog of the Vermont Willow Nursery, Vermont, US).	D. Herman 	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	\N	\N	\N

Mature trees can reach up to 11 m in height with a 0.27 m trunk diameter; the diameter of the crown at the base can reach 5 m (Marchenko, 2017). This selection was developed at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia, by V.I. Shaburov in 1960. The plant was sold by a nursery near Perm, Russia, where it was discovered in 2011 and named by A.M. Marchenko (2017). This is one of five clones from the same cross of S. ×fragilis f. vitellina × S. alba L. (listed as S. alba subsp. vitellina (L.) Schubl. & G. Martens × S. alba L. by Marchenko, 2017). The description of these willows is provided under S. ‘Lyubimecz’. S. ‘Strela Kupidona’ is a compact cultivar suitable for smaller gardens or as a street tree. It has a rather upright crown and its late weeping habit is less pronounced, compared to S. ‘Lyubimets’. S. ‘Strela Kupidona’ resembles S. alba ‘Liempde’ but has brighter stems and is very cold hardy. 	V.I. Shaburov 	A.M.

It is unknown if this hybrid was artificially crossed by Stuart, or collected in the wild (like Erica ×stuartii discovered by him) (Bean, 1981). Bean stated that this cultivar resembles S. lanata, but the pubescent ovary and pedicels, as well as less numerous silvery leaf hairs suggest the presence of S. lapponum. He suggested that it was possible that a few clones are in cultivation, although only female plants are known.  According to Krüssmann (1984), it has a procumbent habit, densely white woolly leaves and particularly dark yellow catkins.

This is one of the three clones from the same hybrid combination, along with ‘Teatral`naya’ and ‘Xmelyovskaya Blestyashhaya’, listed by Marchenko under the heading “Shaburov’s willow hybrids with laurel-like leaves”. A type tree was 16 m tall with a trunk diameter 0.4 m at the age of about 40 years (Marchenko, 2017). This cultivar has a broadly ovate, almost spherical crown because a few trunks branch out almost at ground level.  Branchlets are light-brown/green, glabrous and lustrous with almost black buds. Its leaves are 18 cm long and 4.5 cm wide, dark green lustrous above with waxy undersides. Large bright yellow catkins, which appear with leaves, are fragrant and very ornamental.  ‘Sverdlovskaya Blestyashhaya’ can be planted 2-3 plants per planting hole to achieve a nice specimen with a more spherical crown. It can be planted along rural roads as a snowfence, or as a specimen in large or medium parks in northern regions. When used for street planting, the crown can be elevated by pruning the side branches.	V.I. Schaburov and I.V.

Marchenko (2017) described it as a 6 m tall multi-stemmed tree with branches to the ground, which makes it look like a broad oval-shaped shrub. It can be pruned into a single-stem tree. Stems are green and olive becoming reddish-brown and glossy on the upper portion in winter time. Two year-old branches can reach 3 m forming a weeping habit. Numerous ephemeral shoots 2-10 cm long form in the beginning of summer and shed later. Leaves are two-colored: green above with glaucous undersides. Leaves on the ephemeral shoots have pale color. Seed production is minimal and there is no problem with wind-blown “cotton” in the air in springtime.

A fast-growing, green-barked, weeping tree with a broad oval crown. This is one of a few clones from the same hybrid combination along with ‘Plakutschii Gnom’, ‘Ideal’, ‘Pamyati Mindovskogo’ and ‘Podarok Sud`by`’ (Marchenko, 2017). This cultivar was grouped by Marchenko (2017) with other Schaburov’s cultivars ‘Podarok Sud`by`’, ‘Plakuschij Gnom’ and ‘Vodopad’ under the heading “Shaburov’s willow hybrids with green bark and a weeping habit”. It reaches 10.5 m height, 0.3 m trunk diameter and crown reaching 6 m in diameter at the age of 30 years. Its main branches deviate from the trunk at right angles, then become gradually weeping. Branching pattern is irregular. Annual stems are green or olive color in summer, turning brown-purple on their upper side in fall and winter. Leaves are narrow lanceolate with a narrow tip: green above with glaucous underside. It has an equal distribution of male, female or androgynous catkins.  Flowering is abundant but not as spectacular as, for example, in ‘Plakutschii Gnom’, which has a majority of male catkins. Seed production is minimal and there is no problem with wind-blown “cotton” in the air during springtime. ‘Sverdlovskaja Plakutschaja’ is larger than ‘Plakutschii Gnom’, but smaller than other cultivars from this group. It is suitable for large and medium sized gardens. It can be used as a specimen tree in large parks or planted in an alley planting. 	V.I. Schaburov and  I.V.

Hubbard (1904) called both cultivars as “Caspian willow (Salix pruinosa acutifolia and variations of the same)”, while Lamb (1914) called ‘Patent Lemley’ as “S. pentandra major” and ‘The Lemley’ as “S. pentandra minor”. These cultivars grow best on sandy soils; when grown in heavy clay the soil should be deeply plowed, and lime should be applied when grown in acid soil (Lamb, 1914).  Both cultivars are branched at the base, especially when grown under wide spacing; it is advisable to remove these lateral branches to obtain better rods. The branches of both cultivars, especially ‘The Lemley’, tend to curve at the base and when harvested require special preparation and bundling for manufacturers (Lamb, 1914).  The English author P. Ellmore (1915) who listed them as ‘Patent Lumley’ and ‘Lumley’, notes that along with S. triandra L. ‘American Green’, both cultivars were sent to him by the US Forestry Department in 1910 with a comment that these cultivars are the best suited for transatlantic climatic conditions. It was reported that they grew 1.2-1.8 m during a very dry season in 1911 and escaped an infestation of green fly, which affected the other varieties during that year.

Its origin is unknown, but it was distributed from the garden of the Parliament in Reykjavik, Iceland. Pálsson (1997) suggested this cultivar apparently came from a region with a continental climate. This selection was popular during the 1940s, but after it was severely damaged by late spring frost in 1963, its nursery production was discontinued.  Nice specimens of this cultivar still survive, mostly in the north and east of Iceland. According to T. Uronen (pers. comm., July 2015), this is a broad-leaved cultivar, which most likely originated from Russia. It is possibly a hybrid of S. schwerinii E.L.Wolf × S. udensis Trautv.& C.Meyer (Lagerström & Uronen, 2005; Jonsell, 2000).  	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	\N	\N	\N

The crown becomes semiglobose and broader than tall in older trees. There are no leading shoots, and the branchlets at the ends of more-or-less upright stems are almost the same length, so it looks as if it has been pruned (Rehder, 1925). It was often cultivated in the vicinity of Peking, China, and called “Man T’Ow Liu” meaning “bread willow” because of its resemblance to a round loaf of bread. This cultivar was introduced to America by F.N. Meyer in 1906. Plants growing at Chico, California, were 6 m tall with a 9–m crown spread and had developed dense subglobose crowns in six years. Santamour and McArdle (1988) mentioned that a specimen at the herbarium of the U.S. National Arboretum that was grown from cuttings from the original introduction, was female.  According to M. Dodge (pers. comm., August 2015), this female clone was brought  from China by a missionary who planted it on Navajo Indian land near Farmington in northwestern New Mexico over 125 years ago. In 1957 former New Mexico Governor Tom Bollock purchased this land and decided to propagate these willows, which had survived over 100 years with no care, in order to “green New Mexico”. Tom Bollock named this selection ‘Navajo’ in honor of the American Indians who once lived there.  	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Standard: USNA	Established	‘Umbraculifera’ was the preferred name in the LNWP 2016–2020.	‘Umbraculifera’ was sold by seven North American nurseries (2018 PIO), frequently with the synonym name ‘Navajo’, and was found in trade in the Netherlands (PS). 	\N

It was selected from the same hybrid combination as ‘Record’ and ‘Rekord Krasnoseryozhchaty`j’, and has intermediary ornamental characteristics among the three of them (Marchenko, 2017). It is a fast growing tree with pendulous stems and a broad crown. It is 9 m tall with trunk diameter of 18 cm and crown diameter of 8 m. Branchlets are yellow/olive and glossy. Older stems are covered with lenticels.  Leaves are leathery, narrow and long, sometimes polymorphic, green above with silver-gray undersides, becoming yellow in mid-September, when the majority of other plants are still green.  Leaf drop occurs in mid-October. Catkins are large and very ornamental in spring. They break bud scales very early, at the beginning of winter. First catkins are whitish, then becoming variegated with reddish, yellowish, greenish and grayish coloration due to changing color of the bractsthrough different developmental stages. Then catkins turn smoky gray, and retain this color until anthesis. It is a very ornamental cultivar because of its lacy foliage and pendulous crown, yellowish bark which is attractive in winter, long elegant bi-colored leaves that are especially attractive during windy days. It is a beautiful landscape tree, which can also be recommended for living structures (Marchenko, 2017). 	V.I. Shaburov	A.M. Marchenko 	\N	A.M.

Belyaeva as ‘Sverdlovskaja Isvilistaja 2’ in Belyaeva et al. (2000). The plant is 11 m tall, with 3.5 m crown spread  and 0.2 m trunk diameter (Marchenko, 2017). A single trunk is prominent even in the upper portion of the tree from which thin branches deviate at 40° angles forming a narrow pyramidal  crown. Branches are green with golden-brown buds. Unfolding leaves are reddish, which distinguishes this cultivar from other contorted hybrids.  Mature leaves are contorted, green above with grayish underside. This cultivar has a very attractive arhitecture  in winter because of its contorted branches; it is ornamental during flowering in spring time when it resembles a light-golden candle; in summer its twisted bicolored foliage is also attractive. In fall the foliage remains green late. During prolonged fall without early frost it gradually becomes yellow. If early frost occurs before foliage turns yellow, it sheds green leaves forming an unusual carpet of whimsical bicolored foliage on the ground (Marchenko, 2017). Because of its height and narrow crown, this cultivar is suitable for narrow spaces such as streetscaping with tall buildings where its plantings create strong vertical accents. It needs some selective pruning to remove outgrowing branches to keep its narrow-pyramidal crown. 	V.I. Schaburov 	A.M. Marchenko 	\N	A.M.

It is most popular in central and eastern Europe. This cultivar originated in Switzerland before 1815. S. ‘Vitellina-tristis’ is now superseded by S. × pendulina f. salamonii ‘Chrysocoma’ in much of western Europe. It is often cultivated under the later name S. ‘Tristis’. The name was misapplied widely to other cultivars, particularly to S. ‘Chrysocoma’, which also has yellow branchlets. According to Chmelař (1983), who listed it as S. ‘Tristis’, it was a widely distributed female weeping cultivar that was first noticed in France in 1815; it closely resembles S. ×pendulina f. salamonii ‘Chrysocoma’, but its growth is less vigorous. Older specimens of this cultivar look like younger trees of S. ‘Chrysocoma’; its branches are shorter and less pendent, and it sheds leaves much earlier. This cultivar is sensitive to late frost. Almost all old trees display symptoms of fungal infestation.

The type specimen is 17 m tall with 0.5 m trunk diameter and 6 m wide crown. Its narrow pyramidal crown is formed by short side branches deviating from the trunk at 90° angles, which fork into a few thin pendulous stems forming beautiful cascades. Numerous sylleptic branchlets add density to these cascades in summer time.  Leaves are narrow lanceolate, with a long somewhat curved tip.

This cultivar can reach 6 m height when left unpruned, or after coppicing produces stems up to 3 m long. The vegetative characters of ‘Winter Glory’ are intermediate between S. caprea L. and S. gracilistyla Miq. Branches are thicker and less pubescent than S. gracilistyla. Floral buds are glabrescent, becoming glabrous in age with a few hairs remaining, glossy red, not pubescent as in S. gracilistyla or S. ‘The Hague’. Leaves up to 10 cm, dark green above and paler beneath, their bases cordate. Petioles are 10–12 mm long. Floral buds, differentiated during the previous summer begin to flush with color in August, becoming distinctly red in late autumn and remain attractively red until budbreak in late winter. Flowers are borne in February–March on mostly erect catkins. The fully expanded inflorescences are 5–8 cm long. Stamen filaments are connate.  Catkins have ornamental value and are frequently used for floral cut-stems. It is most attractive in late January through early March with its display of expanding inflorescences. It was named by M. Dodge (Kuzovkina et al., 2016a; 2018 on-line catalog of the Vermont Willow Nursery, Vermont, US) for its long-lasting ornamental value in winter and springtime. Original plants were purchased from Spring Meadow Nursery, Michigan, US, as S. chaenomeloides Kimura and cultivated at Vermont Willow Nursery since 2008. This cultivar was proposed to be a hybrid of S.·×leucopithecia Kimura (Kuzovkina et al., 2016a). Salix·×leucopithecia Kimura was thought to have been cultivated in Japan (Walters et al., 1989), and probably, this selection originated in Japan as well. 	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Established	\N	\N	\N

Leaves have large, kidney-shaped stipules. Filaments are half connate (Krüssmann, 1984). According to Krüssmann (1984), this was a hybrid of S. eriocephala Michx. × S. petiolaris Sm. (as S. cordata Muhl. × S. gracilis Andersson), developed in the US and commonly used in forestry and basketry. Rehder proposed that this was a hybrid of S. purpurea L., with a long history of cultivation in the US for basketry, and S. eriocephala Michx. (as S. rigida Muhl.). But Bean (1981) mentioned that this cultivar is now considered to be S. eriocephala Michx. × S. petiolaris Sm. (as S. gracilis Andersson). He stated that this is a male cultivar, probably a hybrid of S. eriocephala Michx. (as S. rigida Muhl.), introduced from the US to Germany by basket maker Ernst Hoedt and propagated by Otto Schon’s nursery, which distributed three million cuttings of this cultivar as S. americana Hort. ex Schwerin, not Anderss, in 1914 (Bean, 1981). According to M. Dodge (pers. comm., August 2015), this cultivar is very popular among basketmakers in Europe, but has not been available in North America for perhaps a century. Ernst Hoedt, a willow basketry master, illegally imported this clone to Poland from the US after his stay in the US. When the American customs authorities objected to the transit, Hoedt created baskets woven from fresh willow twigs, which he later planted in the Trzciel nursery at the Nowy Tomyśl area of Poland. The new plant known as "the Trzciel American", spread around Europe and nowadays is considered among the best for wickerwork goods.

This is a female clone representing a highly atypical selection from the species that possibly provided the basis for the original species description (Santamour and McArdle, 1988). Santamour and McArdle considered trees at the US National Arboretum (accession NA44011) to be typical for this cultivar. According to Santamour and McArdle, it was likely that this cultivar had been introduced at various points along the ancient trade routes through southern Asia to the Near East, and to Europe around 1730.  It was originally introduced to England during 1748 by Mr. Vernon, and a few trees of this clone still survive near Twickenham. Because of its limited frost hardiness, it has almost disappeared from the UK; however, as one of the parents of S. ×pendulina f. salamonii I.V.Belyaeva (as S. ×sepulcralis Simonk.), this subtropical clone provided significant heat tolerance to its cultivar ‘Chrysocoma’ (http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/salix-x-sepulcralis-golden-weeping-willow; accessed 10 December 2014). ‘Babylon’ was depicted in willow-pattern crockery.

Bean (1981) described this cultivar as a vigorous male plant with polished orange-yellow stems. Leaves are finely serrated, glabrous, bright-green. Catkins are drooping, 6–10 cm long, appearing with the leaves. When it is pruned in spring, its stem color is even brighter than that of S. ×fragilis f. vitellina (L.) I.V. Belyaeva. This cultivar was selected by the basket maker and willow grower William Scaling of Basford, Nottinghamshire, UK, during the 1860s, named S. basfordiana Scaling ex S.J.Salter, and described under the same name by James Salter in 1882 (Salter, 1882). According to Meikle (1984), there are male and female clones of this cultivar. It can be distinguished from ‘Vitellina’, with which it is often confused, by its lustrous leaves and long pendulous catkins. Krüssmann (1984) listed it as S. × ‘Basfordiana’ and stated that this cultivar is a descendant of S. ×rubens  Schrank, which was discovered in the Arden district of England around 1863. It is widely planted today as a basket selection with stems yellow at the base, orange in the middle and bright red at the tips (Stott, 2001).

One of the most widely sold weeping willows, especially in North America where it is known as the “Thurlow weeping willow” and often listed as S. babylonica L. or ‘Tristis’. According to Chmelar (1983), this is an old artificial cross originating in Germany about 1831. The branches are grey-green; branchlets are brittle and pendulous down to the ground. Chmelar described it as a female clone with rough bark and “horny-tipped” buds; the leaves, which have well-developed stipules, shed early in autumn. It was described by Andersson in 1867 as a specimen collected in a garden in Hessen, Germany, and later introduced into commerce by Späth of Berlin (Bean, 1981).

Dodge; pers. comm., Oct. 2015).  Hesseltine gave it another name ‘Purple Dicks’, which should be considered as a synonym. 	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	Not established	N/A	N/A	N/A

Leaves are suborbicular, densely pubescent above with grey-tomentose undersides and prominent venation. Catkins appear with or before the leaves. It occurs on rock-ledges at high attitudes (Meikle, 1975). B. Floderus suggested that this may be a form of S. lapponum L. (Meikle, 1975). According to Bean (1981), it was found around 1900 in the mountains of Scotland by W. Boyd, who raised many well-known alpine garden plants. It was described in 1913 by the Rev. E.F. Linton. It was E.F. Linton who suggested that this was a hybrid of S. lapponum and S. reticulata L., while admitting that this suggestion was not fully satisfactory. Bean remarked that this was a unique plant with female catkins very similar to S. lapponum and foliage similar to S. reticulata. However, Bean also mentioned that some additional characters—the short petioles and short, round glabrescent buds—indicate that S. herbacea L. may also be remotely involved. Listed by Krüssmann (1984) as S. boydii (S. lanata L. × S. reticulata), a low-growing shrub 0.5–0.7 m tall with short, outspread branches and almost circular, 1–1.25 cm long leaves. However, the progeny of a cross of S. ‘Boydii’ as mother and S. lapponum L. as father has most characters of S. lapponum, but not of S. lanata, as Krüssmann suggested (T.

S. fragilis var. bullata Spaeth (1906), S. fragilis var. sphaerica Hryniewiecki (1933); S. fragilis var. capitata Snarskis nom. inval. (1954). A very attractive cultivar, which represents a mutation with a short trunk and dense spherical crown that appears to be trimmed (Skvortsov, 1968, 1999). Interestingly, its branchlets are all of thesame length and form very dense clusters which do not detach easily, unlike S. ×fragilis L. branchlets, which are loose, very fragile and more easily damaged by wind (T. Uronen, pers. comm., July 2015). It has been grown in the Baltic Countries since the late 18 century. The first documented record of this cultivar is a photograph of a 50-year-old tree without a description or a name, taken by Carl Buettner in Kurland (currently Latvia)  and published in Mitteilungen der Deutschen Dendrologischen Gessellschaft in 1915 (Kolkka, 2002). According to Skvortsov (1968, 1999), this cultivar was popular in Lithuania and was occasionally found in Poland, Latvia, and around St. Petersburg, Russia. It was also widespread in Finland and Sweden (Kolkka, 2002). According to Shaburov (1977), it was found only in cultivation and only male specimens were known.  Due to its relatively low height, this cultivar is a promising street tree that can be planted under utility wires. Shaburov provided recommendations on how to grow it in the nursery to get a tree with a well-developed trunk suitable for street planting rather than a multistemmed shrub-type specimen. According to Krüssmann (1984), who listed it as S. fragilis L. ‘Bullata’, this cultivar has a compact globose habit up to 6 m tall and 9 m wide. He stated that it originated in Sweden around 1785. However, Kolkka (2002) noted that based on its current distribution, this cultivar originated rather in Latvia or a nearby area. ‘Bullata’ was the preferred name in the LNWP 2016–2020 as S. ×fragilis L. ‘Bullata’. Salix fragilis var. bullata was listed as the accepted name in the 2018 RHS HD. ‘Bullata’ was sold by two North American nurseries (2018 PIO) and was found in trade in the Netherlands (2018 PS). ‘Bullata’ was most recently sold by one UK nursery in 2006 (2013 RHS PF). The previous references listed ‘Bullata’ as a cultivar of S. ×fragilis, which now belongs under S. euxina I.V.Belyaeva  (I.V.Belyaeva, pers. comm. 2015).

Shoots are red-brown on the upper side at the apex. Leaves are 9.5 cm long and 1.5 cm wide; glossy green above with a somewhat grey underside. They have silky pubescence in spring, later becoming glabrous on the undersides, often with brown margins. Red petioles are 7 mm long. Ovaries are somewhat stalked. The original tree was found around 1700 in Norfolk, England. It was used in England for cricket bats, hence its common name, “cricket-bat willow” (Broekhuizen and Schneider, 1969; Krüssmann, 1984). According to Warren-Wren (1972), only female trees of this cultivar produce lumber of the required standard for cricket bats. According to Bean (1981), ‘Caerulea’ is a female clone sometimes called “blue willow” because its leaves have blue-grey undersides. Meikle (1984) noted that both sexes occur, although the male with less desirable quality for bats is less frequently planted. It is possible that the clone in cultivation is a hybrid.

Schaburov and  I.V. Belyaeva at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia (Belyaeva et al., 2000). The type specimen is 13.5 m tall with a trunk diameter 79 cm at the age of 45 years (Marchenko, 2017). This cultivar was grouped by Marchenko (2017) with others Schaburov’s cultivars: ‘Schater 1’, ‘Valentina Tereshkova’ and ‘Scharovidnii Karlik’, under the heading “Shaburov’s willow hybrids with green bark and pendulous branches”, where “pendulous” means less drooping than in weeping cultivars.  ‘Fantasia’ has a robust trunk. Its fine-textured broad oval crown is formed by very thin branches deviating from larger stems.  Medium-sized sickle-shaped leaves form a lacey crown. Marchenko (2017) described that it resembles „greenish foggy balloons floating and tangled within the crooked stems of the tree”. Leaves are light green above with grayish undersides. It has male, female and androgynous catkins, but the flowering is not very spectacular whe compare to other cultivars because of the high proportion of female flowers. Seed production is minimal and there is no problem with wind-blown “cotton” during springtime. This cultivar can be planted as a specimen in small or large gardens.  Foliage is susceptible to fungal diseases, which is noticeable only at close range. Tip blight can be a problem during humid summers, or mites may infect this plant during drought.  	V.I.

It had been sold for four years prior to this date. Santamour and McArdle (1988) mistakenly listed this cultivar as a “golden-leaved” willow. According to Wandell (1989), this is a golden-barked tree with multiple twisting “corkscrew” trunks, reaching 7.6 m tall and 6 m wide. It has slightly tortuous semi-pendulous branches and somewhat curled leaves; most often a shrub, though it can be a small tree (Dirr 2009). Dirr suggested that it should be correctly listed as S. ‘Erythroflexuosa’. According to M. Dodge (pers. comm. 2015), the stems of this cultivar are very contorted, not just “slightly” tortuous, and this selection is different from S. ‘Erythroflexuosa’ because its stems are not as red; it is also more weeping than other willows with contorted stems.

It was discovered by Izumi Takuya from Ehume, Iyo, Japan. This cultivar appeared as a sport mutation in a controlled planting of S. udensis Trautv. & C.Meyer (as S. sachalinensis F.Schmidt). It reaches 4 m tall and 3 m wide at maturity (US PP No. 19,370 issued in 2008). According to Dirr (2009), the foliage has a rich golden color during the growing season. Gray catkins 2.5 cm long appear on purple stems. This cultivar was sold by a few US nurseries under the English name “golden fantail willow” and by European nurseries as “golden willow”. According to the 2011 Ball Ornamentals Catalog, Ohio, US, where it was listed as “A Ball Ornamentals Exclusive”, this is a highly ornamental compact large shrub with bright gold foliage from spring till fall that keeps good gold coloration even in the Midwest heat. According to the 2014 online catalog of the Forestfarm Nursery, Oregon, US, it has flattened stems. M. Dodge has sold this cultivar for 4 years, but has never observed stem fasciation (pers. comm., August 2015). Published in the Plant Patent US.

A mature tree can reach 18 m in height with a crown diameter of 8.5 m. This cultivar was developed at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia, by V.I. Shaburov (listed as S. alba subsp. vitellina (L.) Schubl. & G.Martens × S. alba L. by Marchenko (2017) and later named by A.M. Marchenko. S. ‘Lyubimecz’ resembles S. ‘Pamyati Bazhova’ but has a smaller trunk diameter and more compact crown. It develops a weeping habit by the age of seven years; in younger plants crowns are pyramidal. Flowering is more spectacular than in S. ‘Pamyati Bazhova’ because of its larger catkins and flower bracts.  ‘Lyubimecz’ is one of a few clones from the same hybrid combination along with S. ‘Oranzhevaya Tolstostvol’naya’, S. ‘Oranzhevaya Tonkostvol’naya’ and S. ‘Strela Kupidona’. These cultivars were described by Marchenko (2017) under the heading “Shaburov’s willow hybrids with yellow-orange bark and a late weeping habit.” They have very bright branches and branchlets, which are very dense (the densest, compared to other Shaburov hybrids). These cultivars have a distinctive appearance when their habit changes with age: when young, they have an upright, narrow pyramidal crown, which later becomes broadly oval and slightly weeping and, by the age of about nine years, the weeping crown is more pronounced. The late weeping habit and extreme cold hardiness are inherited from the male parent, S. alba from the Urals. The summer foliage has an attractive bluish green color.

One of its parents is S. ledebouriana Trautv. f. kuraica Liss. while another parent is described by the authors as a hybrid of S. purpurea L.  This cultivar was selected for basket weaving. Marchenko (2017) described it as a very ornamental plant and listed it under the trade designation FEJERVERK, which translates from Russian language as “Fireworks“. When ‘Mayak-2’ is left unpruned it resembles S. purpurea  ‘Nana’, but it is brighter, more cold hardy and does not break easily under heavy snow. It is a very fast growing shrub: the new growth can reach 2 m in three weeks during spring. Its straight unbranched stems gracefully move with the wind or bend during rain. Marchenko recommends planting 10-15 cuttings or plugs into one planting hole to achieve a dense spherical crown which can reach 3 m diameter after 7 years. For a fountain shape, it should be coppiced every spring 1-1.5 cm above the previous year stumps following the simespherical pattern.

Makino (1904: p. 142) in his description of S. thunbergiana Blume ex Andersson subsp. melanostachys mentioned rudimentary pistils ‘‘linear, subbifid truncate at the top, 1 mm long’’—a teratological change that could be a result of either mutation or hybrid origin.

Krüssmann listed it as S. ×moorei H.C.Watson ex B.White (S. herbacea L. × S. myrsinifolia Salisb.) while S. ×grahamii Borrer listed it as a different species with the same parentage (S. herbacea × S. myrsinifolia). It is likely that Krüssmann attempted to follow White (1890) who listed S. ×moorei as S. herbacea × S. myrsinifolia and S. ×grahamii Borrer ex Baker as S. herbacea L. × S. phylicifolia. E.F. Linton considered S. ×grahamii Borrer to be a hybrid of S. herbacea × S. myrsinites L. According to Meikle (1985), this cultivar was very similar to S. ×grahamii, but with longer narrower bracts, thinly or occasionally densely pilose ovaries and glabrous pedicels. It was discovered by Dr. David Moore on the top of Muckish Mountain, Donegal County, Ireland, in 1866 and introduced to the Glasvevin Botanic Garden from which it was further distributed.  Following Bean (1981), Meikle noted that without doubt it has the same parentage as S. ×grahamii (as S. aurita L. × S. herbacea × S. repens L. (Meikle, 1984)) and should be considered to be its variety. Meikle noted that since S. myrsinites, S. phylicifolia and S. myrsinifolia are not recorded for Ireland or are very rare there, he prefers to equate S. ×grahamii and S. ×moorei and list them as hybrids of S. aurita × S. herbacea ×S. repens.

A roundish shrub less than 1.5 m tall and wide with slender silvery gray leaves (Bean, 1981). Bean discussed the confusion between ‘Gracilis' (the botanical variety f. gracilis (Grenier & Godron) Schneid., which has a decumbent habit that should be considered as part of the normal variation of S. purpurea L.) and ‘Nana’, which should be distinguished as a horticultural cultivar. It was listed by Krüssmann (1984) as ‘Gracilis’ (syn. S. purpurea var. nana Dieck and S. purpurea var. uralensis Späth). According to Krüssmann, this was a dwarf, finely branched female form with narrow leaves, useful for weaving and small hedges; selected around 1900. Often called “arctic blue leaf willow” in the US (Dirr, 2009), although it does not occur in the arctic zone. The native distribution of this species includes Northern Africa and Europe and as its range extends north to only the USDA hardiness zone 3. Therefore, the common name is misleading.

This cultivar is larger than the species and more erect, with stout branches. Leaves are broader, usually permanently silky above; ovary usually pubescent. In Meikle (1984) it was listed as S. repens var. argentea (Sm.)Wimm. et Grab, a variant found on maritime dunes, with robust, ascending, pubescent branchlets; a large broad crown; and blunt leaves with dense silky silvery hairs on both surfaces.

Shaburov in 1960 (Shaburov, 1976; Belyaeva et al., 1999). Shaburov noted that while most of the seedlings that originated from this cross were green-barked, this cultivar had yellow stems that likely appeared due to the hybrid nature of one of its parents, S. × pendulina. Cultivar S. ‘Pamyati Mindovskogo’ has an interesting characteristic: the upper portion of the trunk can bend so as to become almost prostrate; then a new leader stem can grow upward, creating a unique crown habit (Marchenko, 2017). This willow has mostly female flowers, but occasionally there are branches with male flowers or flowers of both sexes. S. ‘Pamyati Mindovskogo’ is the most cold-tolerant yellow-barked weeping cultivar, being hardy to -40°C. 	V.I.

This cultivar, along with ‘The Lemley’, was listed by Hubbard (1904) and Lamb (1914), where both selections were highly recommended for basket production due to their low susceptibility to pests and diseases. Hubbard (1904) called both cultivars “Caspian willow (Salix pruinosa acutifolia and variations of the same)”, while Lamb (1914) called ‘Patent Lemley’ as “S. pentandra major” and ‘The Lemley’ as “S. pentandra minor”. These cultivars grow best on sandy soils; when grown in heavy clay, the soil should be deeply plowed, and lime should be applied when grown in acid soil (Lamb, 1914). Both cultivars are branched at the base, especially when grown under wide spacing; it is advisable to remove these lateral branches to obtain better rods. The branches of both cultivars, especially ‘The Lemley’, tend to curve at the base and when harvested require special preparation and bundling for manufacturers (Lamb, 1914). The English author P. Ellmore (1915) who lists them as ‘Patent Lumley’ and ‘Lumley’, notes that along with S. triandra L. ‘American Green’, both cultivars were sent to him by the US Forestry Department in 1910 with a comment that these cultivars are the best suited for transatlantic climatic conditions. It was reported that they grew 1.2-1.8 m during a very dry season in 1911 and escaped infestation of green fly, which affected the other varieties during that year. The 2018 online catalog of the Vermont Willow Nursery, Vermont, US, notes that this female cultivar has the most attractive foliage of all willows. It lists it as a cultivar of S. ×meyeriana Rostk. ex Willd. with the comment that this cultivar has fragile branchlets. This listing was based upon Zinovjev’s publication (2011) stating that the majority of plants in North America are likely to be selections of  S. ×meyeriana , as S. ×pentandra L. as branchlets are not brittle. Another suggestion is that this cultivar should probably be listed as a hybrid of S. ×pentandra × S. lucida Muhl. (M. Dodge, pers. comm., Feb. 2018).

A pendulous male clone was introduced to the Arnold Arboretum by F.N. Meyer in 1908. Female plants with silky ovaries and green young bark cultivated in the UK were probably introduced by J. Hers during the 1920s along with ‘Tortuosa’ (Bean, 1981). Santamour and McArdle (1988) suggested that since the name “pendula” has been applied to so many weeping willows, its meaning has lost any significance.

The original tree died around 1884 (Elwes and Henry, 1913). According to Späth (1930), S. caprea var. pendula T.Lang was a female cultivar. However, the sex of weeping goat willows was the source of confusion while both clones—male and female—were frequently cultivated under the name S. caprea ‘Pendula’. This problem was discussed by Lancaster (1976), who stated that a male weeping clone was sold in Holland and Germany, while a female weeping clone was common in British gardens. Lancaster proposed to name a male cultivar of weeping goat willow ‘Kilmarnock’ and the female clone ‘Weeping Sally’.  Chmelar (1983) stated that in addition to ‘Kilmarnock’, there was a new staminate clone, the result of crossing a female pendulous S. caprea L. and S. ×erdingeri A.Kern. (S. caprea × S. daphnoides Vill.) backcrossed to pendulous S. caprea. This clone is highly attractive and produces numerous yellow catkins which appear before leaves.

Shaburov and later named by A.M. Marchenko (Marchenko, 2017). A very ornamental tree 8 m tall with a wide crown 10 m in diameter. Branches are scarcely pubescent, glossy. Branchlets are light-green with yellowish tint becoming brownish on the upper side. Leaves are leathery, long and narrow, green above with silver-green undersides and dense, parallel to the midrib, hair. Leaf margin is revolute with glands. Scales of flower buds break very early in springtime. Catkins first have reddish coloration because of the color of bracts, which gradually become darker, almost black when the catkins turn gray. ‘Permyachka’ is very ornamental all year round because of its beautiful bi-colored foliage, which turns yellow in fall, and interesting architecture of the crown with pendulous stems.

Schaburov and  I.V. Belyaeva at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia (Belyaeva et al., 1998). It is a low-growing, green-barked weeping tree selected for the Urals, a region with a short growing season and cold winters. ‘Plakuschij Gnom’ is 1.7 m tall, with a trunk 60 mm diameter and a strongly weeping crown up to 1.5 m in diameter. Branchlets are slender, long, touching the ground, yellow-brown, glabrous or slightly pubescent. Flower buds are similar to the vegetative buds. Leaves are small, 40–60 mm long and 6–12 mm wide, pubescent on both sides. ‘Plakuschij Gnom’ does not flower, according to Belyaeva et al. (1998). According to Marchenko (2017) it can reach 6-7 m height, 0.2 m trunk diameter and 5 m crown diameter at the age of 10 years. This is one of a few clones from the same hybrid combination along with ‘Sverdlovskaja Plakutschaja’, ‘Ideal’, ‘Pamyati Mindovskogo’ and ‘Podarok Sud`by`’. ‘Plakuschij Gnom’ was grouped by Marchenko (2017) with other Schaburov’s cultivars ‘Podarok Sud`by`’, ‘Sverdlovskaja Plakutschaja’ and ‘Vodopad’, under the heading “ Shaburov’s willow hybrids with green bark and a weeping habit”. Its trunk is densely branched from ground level at an early age. Main branches deviate from the trunk at a 45° angle, and often are as long as the main trunk. Timely pruning can shape the crown to form a very attractive small weeping tree. If the lower branches are not pruned, the tree can become multi-stemmed. Sometimes the trunk can arch at the top, and a few side branches develop into leaders making the plant multi-stemmed at a height of 1.5-2 m. Branchlets are olive-green color in summer, becoming glossy and brown, often with purplish coloration, in winter. Leaves are green above with glaucous undersides, narrow lanceolate with attenuate tip.  Flowering is ornamental because the majority of catkins are male or androgynous. Most male catkins are located in the middle of the crown, while female catkins are positioned closer to the upper portion. Seed production is minimal and there is no problem with wind- blown “cotton” in the air during springtime. ‘Plakuschij Gnom’ is a valuable ornamental tree because it is the lowest weeping willow hardy in northern climates.  It is suitable for small gardens and is especially attractive when planted near small ponds. 	V.I. Schaburov and  I.V.

This is one of a few clones from the same hybrid combination along with ‘Plakutschii Gnom’, ‘Sverdlovskaja Plakuchaya’, ‘Ideal’ and ‘Pamyati Mindovskogo’.  This cultivar was grouped by Marchenko (2017) with other Schaburov’s cultivars ‘Plakuschij Gnom’, ‘Sverdlovskaja Plakutschaja’ and ‘Vodopad’, under the heading “Shaburov’s willow hybrids with green bark and a weeping habit”. It is a green-barked weeping tree with a broad oval crown reaching 12 m height and 1 m trunk diameter at the age of 45 years. Its main branches deviate from the trunk at right angles forming sinusoid lines. From these lines the secondary branches of weeping habit produce curtains 5-7 m long, hanging at a distance from the trunk. These curtains produce elegant cascades, which form the beautiful crown of the tree. Foliage is very graceful with the greatest ratio of their length to width at about 7.5:1. Foliage is green above with glaucous undersides, which makes leaves appear bicolored at a distance even on a calm day. Catkins are mostly androgynous; some flowers are also androgynous and abnormal (with some aberrations). ‘Podarok Sud`by`’ is a very ornamental weeping willow for cold climates, and has the longest weeping stems of all Shaburov’s weeping hybrids (Marchenko, 2017). ‘Podarok Sud`by`’ is suitable for large and medium size gardens.

N/A	N/A	N/A	Wandell, 1989; Dirr, 2009	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	1981	N/A	x	9	Canada	An exceptionally cold hardy weeping willow with a broad weeping crown, glossy green, very thick, textured foliage, and golden stems (Wandell, 1989). It is hardy in the USDA Zones 3–7.  According to Wandell (1989), this cultivar was introduced by Morden Experimental Station, Canada, during 1981. According to Dirr (2009), this is a hybrid between S. pendandra L. and S. ×pendulina Wender. ‘Blanda’ with glossy green foliage of S. pendandra   and the weeping habit, stem color, and golden winter bark of ‘Blanda’. According to T. Uronen (pers. comm., July 2015), this cultivar is rather a hybrid of S. ×pendulina f. salamonii I.V. Belyaeva (as S. ×salamonii (Carrière) Carrière). S. ×pendulina f. salamonii   ‘Chrysocoma’ has golden stems as S. ‘Prairie Cascade’.  The second parent, according to Uronen, is rather Salix ×meyeriana Rostk. ex Willd. (S. euxina I.V.Belyaeva × S. pentandra L.) than S. pendandra L. because S. ‘Prairie Cascade’ sets seeds in mid-summer, but not in late-summer or autumn as hybrids of S. pentandra. Also, S. ×meyeriana Rostk. ex Willd. is the more likely parent because this hybrid species was often cultivated in the US, but S. pendandra L. is very rarely found in cultivation (http://www.salicicola.com/notes/salix_x_meyeriana/forgotten_willow.html; accessed  28 September 2018). Therefore, S. ‘Prairie Cascade’ can be recorded as S. alba L. × S. babylonica L. × (S. euxina I.V.Belyaeva ×S. pentandra L.).

N/A	N/A	male 	Kuzovkina et al., 2016a	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	2016	N/A	N/A	1	N/A	This vigorous male cultivar is very similar to ‘Winter Glory’, but its large catkins have aberrations in the form of lumps (Kuzovkina et al., 2016a). The lumps are noticeable many months before anthesis as protrusions of the generative bud scales. They attract attention when catkins form during the preceding year during late July–August, remaining visible during wintertime until the developing structures push off the bud scales and lumpy gray catkins appear. Flowers develop normally. A cross section of the bud reveals a branched axis of the catkin. ‘Rabbit’s Foot’ has long-lasting ornamental value in winter and springtime. Its catkins are very decorative and are frequently used for floral cut-stems. Originally, plants of ‘Rabbit’s Foot’ were procured in 1999 from Klyn Nursery, Ohio, US, as S. chaenomeloides Kimura. In the catalog of Klyn Nursery, its catkins were described as ‘‘the size of a rabbit’s foot‘‘. Therefore, the cultivar was named ‘Rabbit’s Foot’ because of the resemblance of a rabbit’s foot by the virtue of size and structure of the catkins. Verification of this clone in March 2016 confirmed its identity with the U.S. National Arboretum accession NA 57189, which was introduced to US from Fujinami Nursery, Japan in 1985. As with ‘Winter Glory’, this cultivar was also proposed to be a hybrid of S.·×leucopithecia Kimura. Salix·×leucopithecia is thought to have been cultivated in Japan (Walters et al., 1989), and probably, these selections originated in Japan as well.

Santamour and McArdle described the herbarium specimen located at the US National Arboretum, collected in Argentina in 1955 from a female plant labeled as S. babylonica var. sacramenta that had been received under that name from Switzerland. They concluded that it was not possible to validate either sacramenta or ‘Sacramento’, and ruled out any connection of the name with Sacramento, California.    According to Ragonese & Alberti (1958a, 1958b) this cultivar was received from the University of Copenhagen as S. babylonica var. sacramenta Hortus. Ragonese & Alberti (1958a, 1958b) refer to Dr. H.N. Jensen, Director of the Botanical Garden of Copenhagen, Denmark, who asserted that this species was in cultivation since 1893 from cuttings received from Moscow. Dr. H.N.

Bean (1981) considered this cultivar one of the most handsome and vigorous of all willows. It appeared on the property of Baron de Salamon at Manosque, France, before 1864 and was put into commerce in that country by Simon-Louis of Metz in 1869. This cultivar is less weeping than S. babylonica L., and it forms a broad head of branches. Leaves are first pubescent, later becoming glabrous, remaining on the tree until December. Flowers are mostly female and occasionally androgynous. Bean mentioned that older weeping willows, including this cultivar, became uncommon when S. ‘Chrysocoma’ began to spread at the end of the 19th century. Bean considers S. ‘Salamonii’ synonymous with S. ‘Sepulcralis’. Santamour and McArdle (1988) quoted Elwes and Henry (1913) as saying that the young plants (only female trees were known) develop pyramidal crowns with only the tips of the branches pendulous.

Schaburov and  I.V. Belyaeva at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia (Belyaeva et al., 1998). It is a cold-hardy, low-growing shrub with a pendulous crown selected for the Urals, a region with a short growing season and cold winters. This cultivar is 1.5 m tall, with a trunk 85 mm in diameter and a crown diameter up to 1.2 m. Two-year-old stems are thin, yellow/brown, and partially pubescent. Branchlets are short, slender, and reddish at the base. Flower buds are similar to vegetative buds, reddish-brown, elongated, 4–5 mm long and 1.5–2.5 mm wide. Leaves are small, 50–60 mm long and 6–10 mm wide, slightly pubescent, with small (0.5 mm long) stipules. ‘Scharovidnii Karlik’ does not flower (Belyaeva et al., 1998). This cultivar was grouped by Marchenko (2017) with other Schaburov’s cultivars ‘Schater 1’, ‘Fantasia’, and ‘Valentina Tereshkova’, under the heading “ Shaburov’s willow hybrids with green bark and pendulous branches”, where “pendulous” means less drooping than in weeping cultivars. According to Marchenko (2017) this is the most prominent ornamental cultivar developed by Schaburov. It can be quite large: the type specimen is 4.3 m high and 0.3 m in trunk diameter. Another plant, which was planted in one of the parks in Moscow more than 15 years ago is 4.5 m tall and has 4.3 m crown diameter. It does not flower every year, but when it does, the majority of catkins are male.  Foliage is susceptible to fungal diseases, and mites also occasionally infest this plant during drought. ‘Scharovidnii Karlik’ can be pruned into various crown shapes, making interesting “bonsai” type trees.

This cultivar is lower than ‘Schater 1’ and more disease resistant. Its cuttings take root more easily than ‘Schater 1’ (Belyaeva et al., 1999). This is a slow-growing multi-stemmed cultivar with an interesting marquee crown formed by very dense peripheral branches sheltering a void inside the crown (Marchenko, 2017). This cultivar was grouped by Marchenko with other Schaburov’s cultivars ‘Fantasia’, ‘Valentina Tereshkova’ and ‘Scharovidnii Karlik’ under the heading “ Shaburov’s willow hybrids with green bark and pendulous branches”, where “pendulous” means less drooping than in weeping cultivars. This cultivar is less ornamental than the other hybrids developed by Schaburov, but a type tree, which reaches 10 m height with crown diameter 14 m, is very attractive. According to Marchenko, who describes it under a trade designation SHATER, the parents of this cultivar are  S. alba subsp. vitellina (L.)Schubl. & G. Martens) × (S. babylonica L. × S. alba L.) He notes that the bright orange buds, which are very prominent and ornamental in winter, are likely inherited from S. alba subsp. vitellina. These buds give the crown an orange appearance, even though the stem bark is green.  Catkins are androgynous; the majority of them are male and attractive. This hybrid is ornamental in summer as well.	V.I. Schaburov and  I.V.

Schaburov and  I.V. Belyaeva at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia (Belyaeva et al., 2000). This cultivar has a pyramidal crown and long narrow pendulous leaves. It is resistant to industrial pollution. According to Marchenko (2017) the female parent of ‘Permyachka’ was pollinated by a mix of pollen collected from the specimens of S. schwerinii from Perm, the northern part of Lake Baikal and Amur region, which was mixed with S. udensis. A plant with improved cold hardiness was selected from this group of seedlings. This narrow pyramidal cultivar seldom reaches 8 m in height. Its few stems have a sprawling base even at young age.  Branches are almost glabrous and greenish with brown-red spots in summer, becoming olive or brownish in winter.  Older stems are more brownish. ‘Schwerina Ulutschennaja’ has the longest leaves of all willows (and probably of all temperate trees), which can reach 32 cm on coppiced plants. They are bi-colored, dark green above with silver gray undersides, which is very noticeable during windy conditions.  In fall bright yellow coloration of its foliage is followed by an early leaf drop, which starts around mid-September. Its catkins break and release bud scales at the beginning of winter, but flowering starts in early springtime. In the Moscow region, catkins may frequently dry out during winter thaw (melt down) periods before anthesis but in the Yekaterinburg and Tumen regions they flower and produce seeds annually. Even dry catkins are very attractive and resemble numerous small white beads. ‘Schwerina Ulutschennaja’ is suitable for alley plantings, as specimens, or in Japanese gardens where it can be trained to imitate bamboo (Marchenko, 2017).

Its branch tips are usually fasciated up to 5 cm wide (Krüssmann, 1984). According to Smith et al. (1978), the most vigorous shoots are fascinated; less vigorous shoots remain normal. Its dry stems glisten with a rich mahogany brown color. The correct spelling of the epithet is ‘Sekka’, meaning fasciation in Japanese, not ‘Setsuka’, the name under which this cultivar was sold in the Netherlands. The term “sekka” or “sekika” (fasciation) is a compound of “seki” (stone) and “ka” (change or turn into). When these two words are united, the “i” is usually omitted (comment by Meyer (1962) based on pers. comm. with Dr. Ohwi). This cultivar was well known in trade as “fantail willow”, and was one of the most unusual willows, according to Bean (1981). It was frequently cultivated in Japan, and often found in the wild.

Schaburov and I.V. Belyaeva at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia (Belyaeva et al., 1999). This cultivar has weeping contorted branches that are more twisted than in S. babylonica L. ‘Blanda’. This cultivar does not flower (Belyaeva et al., 1999). Marchenko (2017) described it as a 6 m tall multi-stemmed tree with branches to the ground, which makes it look like a broad oval-shaped shrub. It can be pruned into a single-stem tree. Stems are green and olive becoming reddish-brown and glossy on the upper portion in winter time. Two year-old branches can reach 3 m forming a weeping habit. Numerous ephemeral shoots 2-10 cm long form in the beginning of summer and shed later. Leaves are two-colored: green above with glaucous undersides. Leaves on the ephemeral shoots have pale color. Seed production is minimal and there is no problem with wind-blown “cotton” in the air in springtime. It is a very ornamental contorted cultivar suitable for small gardens and large parks in either northern or southern regions. It is hardier than S. babylonica L. ‘Tortuosa’ or S. ´pendulina f. erythroflexuosa I.V.Belyaeva ‘Erythroflexuosa’, which are not top hardy in northern regions and should be annually coppiced because of stem frost damage (Marchenko, 2017).

Schaburov and  I.V. Belyaeva at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia (Belyaeva et al., 1998). A fast-growing, green-barked, weeping tree with a broad oval crown. This is one of a few clones from the same hybrid combination along with ‘Plakutschii Gnom’, ‘Ideal’, ‘Pamyati Mindovskogo’ and ‘Podarok Sud`by`’ (Marchenko, 2017). This cultivar was grouped by Marchenko (2017) with other Schaburov’s cultivars ‘Podarok Sud`by`’, ‘Plakuschij Gnom’ and ‘Vodopad’ under the heading “Shaburov’s willow hybrids with green bark and a weeping habit”. It reaches 10.5 m height, 0.3 m trunk diameter and crown reaching 6 m in diameter at the age of 30 years. Its main branches deviate from the trunk at right angles, then become gradually weeping. Branching pattern is irregular. Annual stems are green or olive color in summer, turning brown-purple on their upper side in fall and winter. Leaves are narrow lanceolate with a narrow tip: green above with glaucous underside. It has an equal distribution of male, female or androgynous catkins.  Flowering is abundant but not as spectacular as, for example, in ‘Plakutschii Gnom’, which has a majority of male catkins. Seed production is minimal and there is no problem with wind-blown “cotton” in the air during springtime. ‘Sverdlovskaja Plakutschaja’ is larger than ‘Plakutschii Gnom’, but smaller than other cultivars from this group. It is suitable for large and medium sized gardens. It can be used as a specimen tree in large parks or planted in an alley planting. 	V.I. Schaburov and  I.V.

Shaburov and later named by A.M. Marchenko (Marchenko, 2017).  This is one of the three clones from the same hybrid combination along with ‘Sverdlovskaja Blestjaszczaja’ and ‘Xmelyovskaya Blestyashhaya’ described by Marchenko (2017) under the heading “Shaburov’s willow hybrids with laurel-like leaves”. ‘Teatral`naya’ is the slowest growing cultivar from this group. It is about 9 m tall with trunk diameter of 26 cm at 20 years. It has multiple trunks and resembles a broadly oval or spherical shrub when not pruned. Branchlets are lustrous, mostly green with brownish coloration on the upper part. Leaves are lustrous dark-green above with glaucous undersides, 11 cm long and 3-5 cm wide. In fall leaves become blackened. Its catkins are not conspicuous.  Seeds are released over an extended period near the end of summer, and there is no problem with wind-blown “cotton” in the air. This cultivar is suitable for medium and large spaces. It tolerates transplanting well because of the fibrous root system.	V.I. Shaburov 	A.M. Marchenko 	N/A	A.M.

Hubbard (1904) called both cultivars as “Caspian willow (Salix pruinosa acutifolia and variations of the same)”, while Lamb (1914) called ‘Patent Lemley’ as “S. pentandra major” and ‘The Lemley’ as “S. pentandra minor”. These cultivars grow best on sandy soils; when grown in heavy clay the soil should be deeply plowed, and lime should be applied when grown in acid soil (Lamb, 1914).  Both cultivars are branched at the base, especially when grown under wide spacing; it is advisable to remove these lateral branches to obtain better rods. The branches of both cultivars, especially ‘The Lemley’, tend to curve at the base and when harvested require special preparation and bundling for manufacturers (Lamb, 1914).  The English author P. Ellmore (1915) who listed them as ‘Patent Lumley’ and ‘Lumley’, notes that along with S. triandra L. ‘American Green’, both cultivars were sent to him by the US Forestry Department in 1910 with a comment that these cultivars are the best suited for transatlantic climatic conditions. It was reported that they grew 1.2-1.8 m during a very dry season in 1911 and escaped an infestation of green fly, which affected the other varieties during that year. This is a male selection according M. Dodge (pers. comm., Feb. 2018). However, this is a female cultivar according to the 2018 RHS HD.

This selection was popular during the 1940s, but after it was severely damaged by late spring frost in 1963, its nursery production was discontinued.  Nice specimens of this cultivar still survive, mostly in the north and east of Iceland. According to T. Uronen (pers. comm., July 2015), this is a broad-leaved cultivar, which most likely originated from Russia.

The crown becomes semiglobose and broader than tall in older trees. There are no leading shoots, and the branchlets at the ends of more-or-less upright stems are almost the same length, so it looks as if it has been pruned (Rehder, 1925). It was often cultivated in the vicinity of Peking, China, and called “Man T’Ow Liu” meaning “bread willow” because of its resemblance to a round loaf of bread. This cultivar was introduced to America by F.N. Meyer in 1906. Plants growing at Chico, California, were 6 m tall with a 9–m crown spread and had developed dense subglobose crowns in six years. Santamour and McArdle (1988) mentioned that a specimen at the herbarium of the U.S. National Arboretum that was grown from cuttings from the original introduction, was female.  According to M. Dodge (pers. comm., August 2015), this female clone was brought  from China by a missionary who planted it on Navajo Indian land near Farmington in northwestern New Mexico over 125 years ago. In 1957 former New Mexico Governor Tom Bollock purchased this land and decided to propagate these willows, which had survived over 100 years with no care, in order to “green New Mexico”. Tom Bollock named this selection ‘Navajo’ in honor of the American Indians who once lived there.

It was selected from the same hybrid combination as ‘Record’ and ‘Rekord Krasnoseryozhchaty`j’, and has intermediary ornamental characteristics among the three of them (Marchenko, 2017). It is a fast growing tree with pendulous stems and a broad crown. It is 9 m tall with trunk diameter of 18 cm and crown diameter of 8 m. Branchlets are yellow/olive and glossy. Older stems are covered with lenticels.  Leaves are leathery, narrow and long, sometimes polymorphic, green above with silver-gray undersides, becoming yellow in mid-September, when the majority of other plants are still green.  Leaf drop occurs in mid-October. Catkins are large and very ornamental in spring. They break bud scales very early, at the beginning of winter. First catkins are whitish, then becoming variegated with reddish, yellowish, greenish and grayish coloration due to changing color of the bractsthrough different developmental stages. Then catkins turn smoky gray, and retain this color until anthesis. It is a very ornamental cultivar because of its lacy foliage and pendulous crown, yellowish bark which is attractive in winter, long elegant bi-colored leaves that are especially attractive during windy days. It is a beautiful landscape tree, which can also be recommended for living structures (Marchenko, 2017). 	V.I. Shaburov	A.M. Marchenko 	N/A	A.M.

A single trunk is prominent at the lower part of the tree and a few robust stems hold the upper portion of the crown.  Branchlets have olive color with some brown-reddish coloration on the upper side. This hybrid has the largest leaves and stipules of all the contorted cultivars developed by Schaburov. Flowering is abundant and during this period “the tree looks like a huge pale yellow cloud descending to the ground”. It makes a powerful statement in the landscape and is suitable for alley or group plantings, and as a specimen (Marchenko, 2017). 	V.I. Schaburov and  I.V.

Belyaeva as ‘Sverdlovskaja Isvilistaja 2’ in Belyaeva et al. (2000). The plant is 11 m tall, with 3.5 m crown spread  and 0.2 m trunk diameter (Marchenko, 2017). A single trunk is prominent even in the upper portion of the tree from which thin branches deviate at 40° angles forming a narrow pyramidal  crown. Branches are green with golden-brown buds. Unfolding leaves are reddish, which distinguishes this cultivar from other contorted hybrids.  Mature leaves are contorted, green above with grayish underside. This cultivar has a very attractive arhitecture  in winter because of its contorted branches; it is ornamental during flowering in spring time when it resembles a light-golden candle; in summer its twisted bicolored foliage is also attractive. In fall the foliage remains green late. During prolonged fall without early frost it gradually becomes yellow. If early frost occurs before foliage turns yellow, it sheds green leaves forming an unusual carpet of whimsical bicolored foliage on the ground (Marchenko, 2017). Because of its height and narrow crown, this cultivar is suitable for narrow spaces such as streetscaping with tall buildings where its plantings create strong vertical accents. It needs some selective pruning to remove outgrowing branches to keep its narrow-pyramidal crown. 	V.I. Schaburov 	A.M. Marchenko 	N/A	A.M.

This variant had been known since 1623 when it was referred to as “the cultivated golden willow” by the Swiss botanist Caspar Bauhin (Bean, 1981).

It is most popular in central and eastern Europe. This cultivar originated in Switzerland before 1815. S. ‘Vitellina-tristis’ is now superseded by S. × pendulina f. salamonii ‘Chrysocoma’ in much of western Europe. It is often cultivated under the later name S. ‘Tristis’. The name was misapplied widely to other cultivars, particularly to S. ‘Chrysocoma’, which also has yellow branchlets. According to Chmelař (1983), who listed it as S. ‘Tristis’, it was a widely distributed female weeping cultivar that was first noticed in France in 1815; it closely resembles S. ×pendulina f. salamonii ‘Chrysocoma’, but its growth is less vigorous. Older specimens of this cultivar look like younger trees of S. ‘Chrysocoma’; its branches are shorter and less pendent, and it sheds leaves much earlier. This cultivar is sensitive to late frost. Almost all old trees display symptoms of fungal infestation. Krüssmann (1978) states that S. ‘Tristis Resistenta’ is a selection of S. ‘Vitellina-tristis’.

Belyaeva at the Botanic Gardens of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yekaterinburg, Russia (Belyaeva et al., 1998). It is likely that ‘Pamyati Mindovskogo’ was one of the parents because of some morphological similarities with this cultivar and the presence of yellow coloration on the bark of some parts of two-three year old branches (Marchenko, 2017). The type specimen is 17 m tall with 0.5 m trunk diameter and 6 m wide crown. Its narrow pyramidal crown is formed by short side branches deviating from the trunk at 90° angles, which fork into a few thin pendulous stems forming beautiful cascades. Numerous sylleptic branchlets add density to these cascades in summer time.  Leaves are narrow lanceolate, with a long somewhat curved tip. Its staminate, pistillate and androgynous catkins bloom simultaneously. ‘Vodopad’ is suitable for alley plantings, and when planted in groups, creates a strong vertical accent. 	V.I.

N/A	N/A	male 	Kuzovkina et al., 2016a	N/A	N/A	N/A	N/A	2016	N/A	N/A	1	N/A	A vigorous male cultivar with upright, somewhat arching stems, large red floral buds and gray catkins. This cultivar can reach 6 m height when left unpruned, or after coppicing produces stems up to 3 m long. The vegetative characters of ‘Winter Glory’ are intermediate between S. caprea L. and S. gracilistyla Miq. Branches are thicker and less pubescent than S. gracilistyla. Floral buds are glabrescent, becoming glabrous in age with a few hairs remaining, glossy red, not pubescent as in S. gracilistyla or S. ‘The Hague’. Leaves up to 10 cm, dark green above and paler beneath, their bases cordate. Petioles are 10–12 mm long. Floral buds, differentiated during the previous summer begin to flush with color in August, becoming distinctly red in late autumn and remain attractively red until budbreak in late winter. Flowers are borne in February–March on mostly erect catkins. The fully expanded inflorescences are 5–8 cm long. Stamen filaments are connate.  Catkins have ornamental value and are frequently used for floral cut-stems. It is most attractive in late January through early March with its display of expanding inflorescences. It was named by M. Dodge (Kuzovkina et al., 2016a; 2018 on-line catalog of the Vermont Willow Nursery, Vermont, US) for its long-lasting ornamental value in winter and springtime. Original plants were purchased from Spring Meadow Nursery, Michigan, US, as S. chaenomeloides Kimura and cultivated at Vermont Willow Nursery since 2008. This cultivar was proposed to be a hybrid of S.·×leucopithecia Kimura (Kuzovkina et al., 2016a). Salix·×leucopithecia Kimura was thought to have been cultivated in Japan (Walters et al., 1989), and probably, this selection originated in Japan as well.

This is one of the three clones from the same hybrid combination along with ‘Sverdlovskaja Blestjaszczaja’ and ‘Teatral`naya’ described by Marchenko (2017) under the heading “Shaburov’s willow hybrids with laurel-like leaves”. This cultivar is very similar to ‘Sverdlovskaja Blestjaszczaja’, only smaller. It is 7-8 m tall with a trunk diameter of 10-12 cm. Branchlets are lustrous, glabrous, light brown-green with almost black buds. Leaves are lustrous dark-green above with glaucous undersides, smaller than in ‘Sverdlovskaja Blestjaszczaja’. Large bright yellow catkins, which appear with leaves, are fragrant and ornamental, but less abundant than in ‘Sverdlovskaja Blestjaszczaja’.
