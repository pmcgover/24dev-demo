2010-Bell-Nursery-update|3|The 2010 Phase 3 Breeding Project was successful.  There were 19 P. alba crosses produced resulting in over 5,000 seedlings that were grown by Patrick McGovern and Brad Bender.  There are about 40 selections that will be carried forward into the 2012 season for further evaluation.  There is an estimated 34,000 plus seeds remaining from the Phase 3 crosses.  The 83xAA04 family continues to show good rooting performance.  Thirteen ASP/SASP shoot rooting tests were performed, resulting in 4 selections that will be compared to the parent family 100xAA10 for hardwood cutting rooting performance. Seven 6 foot plus alba whips were planted in the nursery to evaluate this process.  All survived and more tests are planned for 2012. Two well stocked 288 cell flats were planted as is to evaluate whole flat planting as an early selection technique.  The results were interesting with the high survival rate and 17 selections.|pmcgovern|1|1|1|1|2010-12-16|0
2011-Bell-Nursery-update|4|I have posted my 2011 Bell Nursery Results that describe dormant cuttingrooting results and selections from Phase 3 families (P3) and Phase 2(P2) clones.  I expect to replant the selections in the 2012 nursery withat least 20 cuttings each.  The 2011 growing season was very good withample Spring moisture and Summer heat.  I planted the more standardized 6" cuttings instead of 4" and am pleased with the results.It was interesting to watch the growth of the 4 rooted 1-0 83AA204 treescut back to 3" root and shoots.  Two of these stools grew 12' in thenursery this year!  See the 2011 Bell Nursery Photos for more details.|pmcgovern|1|1|1|1|2011-11-01|0
2012-bell-nursery|5|Planted 2012-bell-nursery.	Half of the 2012 cutting stock was stored in the Bell Ave. refrigerator and sprouted/rooted due to high temperatures.  The other half was stored in Ryans refrigerator and suffered no damage.  About 1/4 of the entire stock was severely impacted by this issue.   All of the pre-maturely rooted stock was planted at the beginning of each replication.  The second replication was affected the most.  I planted the stock as is by forcing them into the ground with no special treatment.  March was much warmer than April (first time in 100yrs) and April had many frosty mornings which may have been stressful on cuttings.  The nursery was kept moist as needed with irrigation. |pmcgovern|2|2|14|2|2012-04-06|0

2011-1xCAGW-Cross|10|Planted 2 flats of this 2011 seed in 2012, cut tips today.	Observed that there are 2 general types of seedlings, alba (tomentose on leaf undersides) and aspen like (no tomentose) on leaf undersides.  I counted 174 total seedlings in Flat B with 47 aspen types (27%) and 109 in Flat A with 33 aspen types (30%). |pmcgovern|2|2|16|2|2012-06-23|0
2012-2xCAG12-Cross|11|C173 x AG15 - planted about 350 seedlings on 6/16/12 that were grown indoors under flourescent lights.  Seedlings today are average 5 tall and in good health.|pmcgovern|2|2|15|2|2012-06-28|0

2012-2xCAG12-Cross|13|Most of the 2xCAG12 seedlings have set bud.  A few are over 6' tall, some are 5' tall the average is about 4' tall.  While all seedlings have obvious alba influence, many have more aspen or alba traits in terms of tomentose on leaf and stems and some have alba leaves vs the aspen types that have the more intermediate (AG) type leaves.	|pmcgovern|2|173|15|2|2012-08-28|0
2012-bell-nursery|14|I surveyed the 2012 Bell nursery today to see what is still actively growing and what has set bud. In general most of my albas and 1xCAGW materials started from 6 cuttings that are over 5' are still growing and those 5' or less have set bud. The 2xCAG12 seedlings average about 4' tall with most (95% ?) having set bud. The 1xCAGW seedlings average about 3' tall with about 65% still actively growing. Those 1xCAGW seedlings were planted 7/2/12 and with Miracle Grow 20:20:20 soluble fertilzer applied several times to help increase growth.|pmcgovern|2|2|14|2|2012-09-03|0
RevisedExternalPlant-IDs|15|The current plant naming standard for external selections is too long and does not scale. A new Plant id syntax is as follows: [NbrLetterFamilyID][ExternalSiteIDNbr][SiteLocationCode].

2012-Bell-Nursery-Results|21|The 2012 Bell Nursery consisted of over 94 clones and over 2000 6" cuttings planted in 10 count sets of 1 to 3 replications.  Sixteen clones have been selected representing 10 different families. A VigorSurvival metric was used as the primary selection model. It consisted ofmultiplying the survival rate by the median diameter (mm) from each cloneset. The speculation is that this model may select clones that root welland grow more vigorously in the first year of a field planting.  The top 13 selections had a rooting average of 84% via 24 replications with atotal of 240 6" dormant cuttings.  Thirteen clones had at least 2 yearsof propagation testing.  Three clones are from the 1xCAGW family (CAG204 xOpen Pollinated) and have P. grandidentata and P. tremula characteristics.There were 150+ seedlings grown from the family 2xCAG12 (AG15 x C173).The parents of this cross have performed well in Michigan's UpperPeninsula.  The 2013-02-02-B WASP Test Observations: A 16 day WASP testof the 16 2012 aspen selections.  It compared each clone's dormant 4" tip cutting rooting potential with test parameters: no-soak and 4, 4" tip cuttings/clone using the WASP protocol.  The average rooting was 89% which compares to 79% average rooting for the 16 2012 nursery selections.  Nine of the 16 clones rooted 100%, however only 1 of the 9 rooted via ASP shoot after 11 days.  The 2013-02-02-C 2xCAG12 WASP Test Observations:  A16 day WASP test of 2xCAG12 aspen ortet cuttings to compare tip rootingresults with a potential rooting percent metric. The average tray(1 clone/tray) rooting was 65%. The average tray score was 20.05 (maxis 60). The CAG204 control may have been compromised but it rooted 25%and scored at 13. I replanted the best 9 clones and may ramp 5 of themfor a potential 2014 test.  There were 33 test ortets 24% (8/33) and8 ortets that had a perfect score of 60. I expect perhaps 4 of these perfect rooters to show good rooting in the 2013 nursery and perhapsa few that had low scores as well.|pmcgovern|1|1|1|1|2013-04-10|0
WASP-2013-A|22|A 2013 WASP rooting test involving 93AA12 that rooted 60% (24/40) in 2012 and 15AG4MF (aka AG15) that did not root at all.   It was interesting to note how poor the water soak tests performed, but it could be chance since there were only 2 reps and one rep had small diameter cuttings or that the 24hr soak was just too long.  I certainly need to decrease the number of treatments and increase the number of reps.  The willow soak treatment was interesting and might be worth another look but I am sticking to no pre-soaks for my upcoming ramp ups.  I guess it was not too surprising that 100% of the 93AA12 cuttings of at least 7mm dia rooted, but it is a bit surprising to see that all 4 of the 93AA12 tips (2-3mm dia) also rooted.  Clone 93AA12 rooted 60% (24/40) in 2012 nursery, and it rooted 88% in this test (avg of both No Soak tests).  If this type of difference is real (repeatable over time), then perhaps these WASP test stats could have more value in selecting good rooting clones than field rooting results that are subject to more variation.|pmcgovern|193|2|18|6|2013-02-01|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ar-SwoTVeWFadEFfYW11X21iamFKX0tKNHRsWWlrR3c#gid=13

ASP-2013-D|24|3/26/13: The 2xCAG12 WASP to ASP cuttings failed.  Ortets #26 and #30 did root as ASP but poorly.  Perhaps my ASP conditions were bad, perhaps these CAG clones can root but not ASP meaning there is little to no correlation between dormant stem rooting and ASP rooting.|pmcgovern|1|1|1|1|2013-03-26|0

2013-Open4st-Nursery-Results|44|1/1/2014: The 2013 Nursery consisted of over 13 Phase 3 (P3) selections, 10 new Phase 4 families and 144 2xCAG12 ramets.  It is expected to yield over 700 - 10" cuttings and 1300 1-0 stock plants and seedlings.  A Vigor Survival metric was used as the primary selection model. It consisted of multiplying the survival rate by the median diameter (mm) from each clone set.  The 13 P3 selections averaged 82% rooting from 6" cuttings over a 2 or 3 year test period.  The best rooting 2013 clone was 101AA11 with 98% rooting via 39/40 cuttings in 4 replications. The 2xCAG12 family was root tested via 6 - 6" cuttings per 34 ortets and averaged about 80% rooting.  Fourteen ortets rooted 100%. 1xCAGW selections - Observed pure aspen traits in terms of leaf, stem and roots, and some also root well.  Clone 1CAGW01 was planted in planted 7 replications of 65 - 6" cuttings with diameters ranging from 3 mm to 14 mm and a mean rooting of 73%.  However, there was 83% survival from  cuttings that were 10 mm or greater in diameter. Future tests will include cuttings with a 7 mm cutting diameter.  Ten aspen crosses were produced in 2013.  They represented a variety of alba hybrids with most leaf/stem traits meeting parental and intermediate expectations.  Four bigtooth x Open pollinated families - Bigtooth females from urban areas had low seed set.  Open pollinated seed from McGovern's RNE alba aspen site had vigorous AG like progeny. These seedlings were planted at the end of June.  The gxg seedlings averaged 2' and the AGs averaged 4'.|pmcgovern|1|1|1|1|2014-01-01|0

2014-Open4st-Nursery-Results|50|12/24/2014: 2014 Open4st Nursery Results:  We planted 1854 total aspens representing a variety of stock types with 1173 aspens surviving in the 2014 nursery.  Final tallies include 980seedlings from 24 families, 820 rooted cuttings, 24 rooted stock, 184 ortet rooted cuttings and 145 cuttings propagated via WASP. 24 aspen families were grown at Rakers Greenhouse with a 38% mean germination rate, resulting in 1173 seedlings. Each family was measured for the tallest and median height tree within about 3' of the tallest tree (about 20 trees). The overall tallest tree was 156 cm (15xb), the mean tallest was 126 cm and 88 cm for the mean median height. Six families had germination rates at 10% or less.  Four of these families had the female parent Plaza AG.  The other 2 families involved an AAG trihybrid and a bisexual AG 9AG105.  It will be interesting to see if these low germinating families will continue to have progeny with low germination rates that could be leveraged to produce effectively sterile materials.  A general observation was made that bigtooth parents are more difficult to breed than other aspens. The flowers have waxy coating that requires soaking the branch in warm water for about 30 minutes.  Female bigtooth aspens are difficult to work with but eventually produce viable seed. Therefore female CAG clones may be more valuable.  Family seedlingleaf/stem variability was subjectively scored on a 1-5 scale with 1 beinglow and 5 being high variability within the family. The mean score was 3.54. The 4 families with a 5 score were 9xbr, 5xrb, 4xrr and 1xbar.Three of these were mated with an AG  parent but 2 were the bisexual 9AG105. 5xRB had a 35% seed germination rate, the others were lessthan 7%.  It was interesting to note that 1xBAR failed to germinate at Rakers but McGovern produced 4 seedlings likely because they were planted immediately after collection. It will be interesting to see if there willbe any good rooting and or vigorous selections from these families.  Five families scored a 2 for variability, 3 were of CAG and bigtooth parentage (8xbg, 18xbg, 19xgb).  2014 Family comparisons:  While I think there is no seedling to long term field growth correlation, it is interesting to note family seedling growth patterns.  Six families consisted of CAG male (CAG177) or female (CAG204) mated to 6 bigtooth aspens and one smalltooth (P. tremuloides). The mean of their tallest trees was 131 cm, exceeding the mean of 126 for all families and the best AxA family (107xAA) with 138 and the best GA F1 from 4xgw with 123 cm. The tallest tree of these families was a 7xbt which was the 4th tallest tree for all families. Four of these 6 families had median heights above the mean value of 89. It will be interesting to see how these CAG x aspen families compare to F1 AGs and the CAG F2 crosses to show if hybrid vigor can exist apart from an F1 cross. These types of crosses hold a lot of potential if they are productive because they employ a wild and diverse parent with potential for good rooting and selection possibilities from recombination.Parental Sibling Observations: Two sibling male/female bigtooth aspens (gg102 and gg101) with Lower Penninsula parents were mated to 2 siblingmale/female Canadian CAG clones (CAG204 and CAG177).  The families 18xBG and 19xGB had both bigtooth parents G5 and G6 were growing about 300' apart from Michigan's Upper Peninsula in an area known for its  figured aspen wood. There were interesting 1 year seedling differences betweenthese families.  Both crosses had similar Rakers germination rates (38%for 18xBG vs 33% 19xGB) but 18xBG had 1 Rakers flat seeded vs 1/2 flatfor 19xGB.  18xBG ranked 3rd in median height (107cm), behind 15xB and14xB CAG families while 19xGB ranked 13th (83cm) the shorter than allother CAG x native aspen families.  Note that the 6th ranked family 13xGB(102cm) with Lower Peninsula parents had a female bigtooth mated to themale CAG177.  It was interesting that G5 and G6 performed so differentlyand that G5 outperformed all others despite its Northern source in this one year study.  If the 18xBG to 19xGB vigor differences continue to later stages, then perhaps there is significant selection potential for aspen parents from any given region.  The family with the tallest trees (tallest and median) is the CAG family, 15xB (c173 x 9ag105). Note that2xB (c173 x AG15) from 2012 had a clonal selection, 2B25 that was thetallest in the 2014 nursery at 320 cm. Both families differ only by the P. alba female parent on the AG side (A10 vs. PCA2).  It was observed that the 15xB had high stem variation in terms of diameter, form and bud patterns relative to the 2xB family.It will be interesting to track the performance of all 4 CAG crosses, compare them to F1 AGs and CAG204/CAG177 and breed them with native aspens.  The top 3 familiesfor median diameter were 15xb, 14xb and 18xbg. The top 3 families for tallest single tree height were 15xb, 20xbs and 14xb. The top 3 families for the greatest range (variation) from tallest tree to the median were 20xbs, 5xrb and 107xaa.  It will be interesting to see if there are any correlations to be made from future field performance results back to these nursery seedling results.  The 'Plaza' wild AG performed poorly from a breeding perspective. It was found in NE Grand Rapids in a fertile low land area with many hybrids.  It is likely a wild AG clone but I can never be sure of its parentage. There were 4 crosses with Plaza all had Rakers germination rates lower than 11%. These female flower branches were taken from the lower branches of a huge tree so it would beinteresting to do crosses with better quality branches to investigate if the issue is branch or compatibility.  Conducted a Leaf Study: Compared leaf shapes/margins to overall phenotypes and family types. In general,families with more than 50% alba parentage had more lobed shaped leaves with a cordate to ovate pattern (alba like). Families with less than 50%alba tend to have more intermediate cordate shaped leaves somewhat typical of F1 AG hybrids. While typical F1 AG and CAG familes are 50% alba the AGs have intermediate leaves, but the CAG families tend to have more alba lobing and tomentose with intermediate outliers. Perhaps this can be attributed to the recombination of a double hybrid and that the CAG parents tend to have more alba than intermediate leaf traits. The CAG(B) families mated with AG crosses and 11xAB tended to have the most leaf variation (mixtures of lobed and intermediate). Most alba types had dentate to sinuate leaf margins. Only 12xRB and 7xBT were scored to have doubly serrate margins. Other families had variable margin patterns.  See: Open4st Aspen Clonal/Family Leaf Shape Photos The 20xbs family did not appear to have the expected aspen traits (too much alba) of a CAG xP. smithii. We observed that the male parent 4xBT has alba like leaves (like AGA or canescens) and is likely the mistake causing this issue. The 9AG105 clone is bisexual and was mated to C173 (15xB median=128), CAG177 (5xRBmedian=60), Plaza AG (3xRR median=78), CAG204 (9xBR median=80). It wasinteresting that 15xB was the best family over all and with intermediate variability. 9xBR ranked 15th for median height, while its sibling reciprocal 5xRB ranked 19th for median height and had the second highest height range.  The family 7xBT was the only CAG backcross to employ the native P. tremuloides.  It ranked 8th in median height rank (100cm) but had the tallest seedlings from Rakers (6").  It will be interesting to compare this family to the other CAG x B families.  The clone 101AA11 (30AA5MF x NFA) had 98% rooting over 2 years with 59 cuttings survived.  It is the best aspen rooter and should be used in future crosses.  Figured Wood: Observed consistent undulating grain patterns in 13-17mm radially split sections of 1 year lightly figured AGRR1 stems.  This split wood process will be used as part of the early clonal selection.  Also, collected four bigtooth clones from an area known for figured aspen.  Converted the Competition Indexer Program to the Postresql database and integrated with the online r4st database program.  Nursery Context: Most of the Bell Nursery cutting material was planted on 4/20/14 in a 672 square foot nursery (22' x 15 and 19 x 18). The ramet cuttings were 6" long with diameters ranging from 7mm to ~13mm.  Mini-stools were planted that consisted of a 1-0 stock plant that is 6" long with a 1-2" root length. The cutting material was planted in rows planted on 30" centers and seedlings on 36" centers with dual rows of cuttings 4" apart and cuttings planted about 2" apart in each row. The internal 4" between the rows was covered with Miracle Gro Sphagnum Peat Moss, which had someplant food and absorbed water easily. The area between the double rowswas covered with green grass clipping mulch. These materials helped toreduce weed growth and prevented hardening of the top soil layer that istypical on this site after repeated watering. The nursery was irrigatedas needed with a 5' tall sprinkler. The last seedlings were planted on 7/2/14 and most materials had bud set by 9/22/14.|pmcgovern|1|1|1|1|2014-12-24|0
2015-Open4st-Nursery-Summary|51|10/19/2015: The primary 2015 focus was to propagate, test and select clones derived from earlier Phase 3-4 breeding efforts.  The following is a summary ofthe year's progress. We planted 3463 total aspens representing a variety of stock types with 2206 aspens surviving in the 2015 nursery.  Final tallies include 319 unique clones via 453 test replications with a mean survival rate of 61% and 153 Plus Trees noted for their outstanding performance. The stock type distributions are: ODC1-0, WASP, DC, 1-0, 1-1 and oDC.  The 2015 nursery contains 319 clones represented by 57 different  families, 43 of which are from recent McGovern Breeding Program  (MBP) crosses and 14 are from the wild or outside programs that  include clones.  See the Phase 4 Breeding Matrix for details on  the most recent MBP families. There were significant germination differences within families listed on the Phase 4 Breeding Matrix that may illustrate selection potential for selecting less fertile trees.  For example the male F1 hybrid 9AG105 and female Plaza AG had combined 8 cross progeny germination rates under 25%.  There are many variables to germination rates such as parental combining characteristics, branch health/age and seed age that can impact germination rates.  However, it may worthwhile to investigate if specific crosses can produce selections with desirable traits including effectively sterile progeny to prevent interbreeding with native populations.  The ODC and ODC1-0 dormant cuttings planted in the 2015 nursery had  57% mean survival rate (1603 trees).  There were 146 aspen clonal selections from the 2015 nursery that will be carried forward to 2016.  These selections had a 65% average survival rate for the DC and ODC1-0 stock types. Note that most of this material was planted with 6" cuttings and diameters ranging from 13 - 4 milometers.  We speculate that aspen field grade cuttings of 10-12" will have much higher survival rates.  The ODC1-0 stock types consisted of 5 - 6 ortet 6" cuttings planted with the ortet 1-0 mini-stool.  The cuttings were scored with survival and median collar diameter, along with the 1-0 mini-stool collar diameter.  These metrics were combined to form the stool vigor survival metric (Stool VS).  The replicated DC 6" stock types also had their survival rates and median collar diameter tabulated to form the Vigor Survival (VS) values. The hypothesis is that if the VS and Stool VS nursery metrics are recorded then later field trial patterns may show useful correlations. Below are the basic formulas.  end_quantity / td.start_quantity AS survival_rate, (end_quantity /  td.start_quantity) * td.collar_median_dia_mm  AS vigor_survival,  (end_quantity / td.start_quantity)  * td.stool_1_1_collar_mm  AS stool_vigor_survival The online r4st Postgres database contains several 2015 Nursery views that list the details, selections and selection summaries.  The vw_nursery_2015_selections table has the column, new_old_clones_ranked_vs_stoolvs that lists older and new (1 yr ODC1-0) clones.  These clone names were used to assist with clonal selection for the 2016 materials.  The older clone names contain the syntax:  <CloneName~VigorSurvivalMetric-VigorSurvivalPlusTreeMetric>.  The new one year clones have the format:  <CloneName-StoolVSMetric-StoolVSPlusTreeMetric_1_ODC1-0>. Three unrooted 6' aspen whips were field planted at 10" deep in the Spring of 2015Planted field trial at one site (see: 2B16 2015 Unrooted Whips).  All 3 whips survived with healthy stems that had about 18" of growth.  The 2B16 clone has a 3 year nursery 6" cutting survival rate of 54%.  A 3 year old CAG x T clone was observed with Bronze Leaf Disease (BLD).  This was not unexpected since native but rare, T x G families are highly susceptible to BLD. This may provide an interesting opportunity to study the disease and observe if different family/parent combinations would produce resistant strains.

2016-Propossed-Open4st-Activities|52|08/14/2016: The following are proposed Open4st activities that will be scheduled for implementation: Select 40 to 70 clones for future field trials.  Selection criteria will likely focus on vigor survival traits of cuttings and plus tree performances of cuttings and stools.  Enter these clones in the r4st Plant database table with relevant details. Assign aspen materials to Hybrid Classes. Rename selected families and clones that have long, confusing names (eg. change 5xCAGR to 5xBR). Designate aspen materials that will be used as controls in the r4st Plant table (eg. parents, tested clones). Distribute cuttings or rooted stock to cooperators for field trials.  Design a .5 acre field trail scenario that considers the same  spacing, number of plants, block and plot strategies.  Document  cooperator sites in Google drive and later r4st database with  measurements. Update Open4st FAQ docs to serve as White Papers describing the what how of our aspen culture. Include:  How to plant and maintain aspens.  How to propagate aspens -  WASP/ASP, Rootlings, traditional root propagation, ... Produce a collection of YouTube videos like aspen culture, propagation and breeding.  Emulate this open4st video.  Plant key selections and controls on DOT sites for an aspen seed/cutting orchard:  Use 1-1 mini-stools lifted from Bell nursery.  Soak in water for  24 hours before planting.  Cut stools down to 24" total  height. Cut roots to 2.75" width and use a 3" auger to  bore a 12" deep hole.  Dip or brush mini-stools ends with  thick paste of JRM SoilMoist Endophyte (1/2 tsp/100cc water),  place in hole, push in a little topsoil, then mix in 1 handful  (cup) of MiracleGro peat moss with the topsoil.  Plant 2 rows  on 9x9 centers, rows 30' apart.Also plant 20" cuttings of control clones at closerspacing with/without JRM dip.  Wrap above ground stem with 12" high x 10" wide fabric  sleeves, secure with tack at the bottom, staple edges, except  for 3" at top to let shoots through.  Staple one lengthwise  sheet of Bounce dryer sheet to the inside of the fabric sleeve  for cheap deer/rabbit/insect repellent.  Spray glysophyte around  trees in mid May and July. Test 8" cuttings in nursery with JRM/Peat moss dips.|pmcgovern|1|1|1|1|2016-08-14|0
2016-Open4st-Summary|53|09/27/2016: The primary 2016 focus of the Open4st project was to propagate, test andselect clones derived from earlier breeding and nursery selection efforts.Here are highlights of the season:  # 2016 Nursery Stock Types#: The following stock types were used in the 2016 nursery: 8" Dormant Cuttings (DC): Dormant cutting lengths were increased from 6" to 8" in 2016 to make final nursery selections that were closer to the standard 10" field grade cutting length. Mini-Stools (MS):  1-0 stock cut to 10" length with roots pruned to 1" laterals and having a 3" top stem.  Family Dormant Cuttings: (FDC): A single family 8" dormant cutting taken from the ortet at about 2" from the root collar.  Other minor materials planted include Seedlings (SEL), 1-1 stock, and WASP stock.  # 2016 Nursery Summary#: The 2016 Bell Nursery was irrigated, mulched, fertilized and located on about 1000 square feet with 17 rows, most planted on 30" centers.  See: 2016-Bell-Nursery spreadsheet and 2016 Nursery photos. The 2016 nursery had 2802 trees of various stock types planted with 2127 live trees surviving (76%).  The 8" Dormant cuttings (DC) were planted in rows 30" apart with cuttings spaced 2" within the row and separated by 4" double rows and MiracleGro Peat moss applied between the cuttings.  All clones were represented with 5 cuttings in one or more replications.  Mini-Stools (MS) were planted in rows 30" apart with trees  spaced 5" within the row. Most clones were represented by 3  mini-stools in one replication. The mean rooted cutting collar median diameter was 7 mm.  The mean rooted median Mini-Stool collar diameter was 13.2 mm.  There were 178 Mini-Stool clones planted spread across 468 trees and ending the season with a 94% survival rate and an average median stool collar diameter of 13 mm.  There were 174 dormant cutting clones planted spread across 1500 cuttings with a 74% survival rate and an average median collar diameter of 8.2 mm.  For more details see the r4st database and the 2016 Nursery Stock  Summary.  # 2016 Clonal Selection Process#: It is important to note that most of the McGovern Breeding Program (MBP) materials in the 2016 nursery have not been field tested. Therefore the nursery selection process focuses on the primary objectives of promoting vigorous, good rooting clones from a collection of diverse aspen families.  Future clonal field trials are needed to select durable regional clones, investigate any nursery to field trial correlations and leverage future breeding opportunities with the elite performers.  Each 2016 MS and DC replication was scored for median lower collar diameter, survival rate, a subjective Plus Tree score of Y (Yes) and the estimated number of 12" field grade cuttings with a top diameter at least 9 mm termed, field_grade_ft.  In previous years the dormant cuttings were 6" long to select clones that can root at a shorter length and for easier storage/handling/lifting.  They were previously ranked using a Vigor Survival Plus Tree formula represented by: (median collar diameter * survival rate) + sum of Plus Trees).  Vigor Survival is the product of (median collar diameter * survival rate).  Plus trees are a subjective Yes score for a given replication that were observed to have outstanding performance in its environment.  It is handy for cross checking performance across replications but its subjective nature makes it variable.  The primary 2016 selection criteria was based on dormant cutting vigor survival and the number of 12" field grade cuttings with a top diameter at least 9 mm termed, field_grade_ft.  The mini-stool data was not used for selection since they only had one replication and had variable mini-stool stem sizes.  The formula for ranking dormant cutting performance was termed, cut_fcut_rep represented by: average(vigor_survival) + average(field_cuttings_ft) * (count(replication_nbr) *.1).  This metric is objective (doesn't use the Plus Tree values) and factors in the variable number of replications since each clone may have 1 to 11 replications (eg. 100AA12).  The above formula provided the primary 2016 selection rank criteria.  However, the final sets were manually adjusted to ensure diverse family and species representation while maintaining adequate vigor and survival (propagation) metrics.  # 2016 Selection Types#: The 2016 selections are subject to change before or during the Spring 2017processing date.  See the vw_2016_6_nursery_field_summary view details forcurrent selection details.  See the 2016 Nursery Stock Types for aggregateselection type details.  Below are details for the 2016 Selection Types: (Primary - Elite selections:)  These selections will represent about 30 clones that are recommended for field trials.It includes 4 FDC clones that require additional nursery testing.  These clones are represented by 18 different families and 5 selection types (A, AH, H, ASH, C).  The primary DC selections had 91% survival rate with 384 trees and 771 feet of field grade cuttings available for the 2017 season.  (Secondary - Archive selections:)  These selections represent about 30 clones that will be archived for later use, since most have siblings in the primary group.  These DC selections had a 91% survival rate with 246 trees and 412 feet of field grade cuttings available for the 2017 season.  (Tertiary - Parent selections:)  These represents parents of previous MBP crosses.  These DC materials are represented by 11 clones and a 65% survival rate with 55 available trees and 11 field grade cuttings. Most simply do not propagate as well as their progeny.  (Families - Re-test selections:)  These represent 2 2016 families 25xR and 6xGG that will have some trees planted in a 2017 field and all others tested as FDC 8" ortet stock in 2017 nursery that will also preserve each Mini-stool.  It will be very interesting to see if any of the native bigtooth 6xGG aspen FDC cuttings can grow roots. (Discarded Clones:) About 100 clones are expected to be discarded. They have a 64% survival rate.  # Family Classification System#A classification system was developed to help categorize these aspenmaterials.  Below is a listing of these classes which are also includedin the rank_class field of the vw_2016_2_nursery_key_summary table.The final selections and counts are subject to change.  (A = Alba x Alba - More or less 100% AxA materials (eg. 83xAA04,  107xAA).  3 Primary selections) (AH = Alba Hybrid - Have more  than 50% P. alba (eg. 2xBA, 22xAR). 8 Primary selections) (ASH  = Aspen Hybrid - Have less than 50% P. alba (eg. 22xBG, 7xBT).  8 Primary selections) (H = Hybrid - Have 50% P. alba (2xB, 25xR,  5xCAGR). 13 Primary selections) (C = Control - 1 clone (DN34))  (N = Native (eg. gg12))  # Miscellaneous Notes:# There were 644 aspen seedlings planted that used the GG12 figured aspen as the male parent.  In September 2016, 375 seedlings survived with a 75% survival rate and an average median collar diameter of 6 mm.  See: 2016 MBP Aspen Crosses.  In 2017 8" cuttings of these materials will be tested for rooting and about 10% will be planted in field trials.  The female AxAG hybrid AAG2002 was mated to the native bigtooth clone, GG12 (1xARG) with 5% germination and open pollinated (2xARW) with 6% germination.  These similar germination rates help validate comparisons between artificial crosses and open pollinated matings.  See: Selecting for Effectively Sterile Clones. The open4st team hopes to ramp up, test and distribute the new selections to cooperators seeking to participate in open Aspen research.  The final selections will need to be carefully reviewed and consider archiving other lesser rooting clones that may have phytoremediation potential.  There are 144 total clones with rooting over 49% (see: vw_2016_7_dc_rooting_over_49percent).  These may need to be screened separately.  The selections should also consider future breeding opportunities, while avoiding inbreeding.  For example many MBP families use similar parents such as A10 and NFA.  CAG Families like 14xB may require more selections, since it can be mated with more promising clones like 100xAA11.  112 MBP 5' 1-0 aspen trees were planted as archive clones.  See Photos.  Two WASP experiments were conducted using the JRM Endophyte mycorrhizal product.  See 2016 WASP Tests.  # 2017 Stock and Nursery Projections#Below are the 2017 projections to distribute and plant the 2016 aspenstock: * For each primary selection, plant 2 deer-proof 6' sized trees at an archive MBP DOT site and plant 14, 8" cuttings or mini-stools in the MBP nursery.  This material could be used for a 2018 field trial. * For each secondary selection, plant 1 deer-proof 6' sized tree at an archive MBP DOT site and plant 4, 8" cuttings or mini-stools in the MBP nursery.  * Distribute 4 or 8, 10" cuttings of primary, secondary clones and 8, 6xGG and 25xR seedlings to Purdue for a 2017 field trial.  * Distribute 10 clones for a potential MSU Pytorediation clonal lab test.  * Plant selected FDC and Family (6xGG, 25xR) cuttings and mini-stools in the 2017 nursery, select top clones and check cuttings for figure.  There are about 1300 cuttings that will be planted in the 2017 Bell nursery with about 380 available linear foot of growing area.  If cuttings were planted in double rows at 4" apart (6 cuttings/foot) then 2280 cuttings could be planted (380 feet x 6/foot).  If cuttings were planted in double rows at 5" apart (4.8 cuttings/foot) then 1340 cuttings could be planted (380 feet x 4.8/foot). I will plant at 4" spacing.  * Change all references of the Primary Elite selections to just Primary. The Elite designation should be reserved for final selections, not nursery selections.|pmcgovern|1|1|1|1|2016-09-27|0
