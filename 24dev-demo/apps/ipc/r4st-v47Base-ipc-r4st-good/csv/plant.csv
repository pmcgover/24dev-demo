A502|11|Canada obtained this tree from Casale Monferrato, Italy in 1967 as clone I58-57.  It has good form, some sun scalding, fair rooting, aspen features, gets BLD.  Flowering: Reliable for seed bearing, need to let the whole catkin shed.  Breeding Notes: When combined with Bolleana, progeny roots well, but the cross a502 x Bolleana may be not durable, but the cross A502 x Jamie is durable. Rooting: 1989=45%, 1990=13%, 1992=21%, 2004=24%, Phase 3 breeding notes: A502 catkins were about 10mm long on 3/28/10 at RNE.  I estimate that most albas will peak receptivity around 3/31 as we are expecting 70 degrees on 3/31..  The last A502 flowers were harvested on 4/9/10, almost 1 month from when they were started...

SER41|15|Rick Hall collected this pollen from an Italian plantation near the town of Ghivazzano on the east side of the track, north of the train station.  This tree was on the NW corner of the plantation.  It should have good rooting, since it was collected from a plantation.  Broad crown, large diameter, medium steep branch angle, not exceptionally tall.  Good pollen vigor.  Apparently a local man had made a collection of promising trees and established this plot 30 years ago.  Ser is an abbreviation for Serchio River, the valley in which all of these collections were made, north of the city of Lucca.  This is the only region in Itally and maybe Europe where P. alba is grown as a commercial species in plantations.  There has been a long history of selecting trees that root well for use in the plantations.  The assumption is that this area has natural populations that root well.  This area is about as far South as one can go in Italy and have sufficient cold hardiness for our winters.  |M|0|0|0|lat44 05' N; long 10 25' E; alt 100 m.

NORTHFOX|19|Discovered in 1993 and may be the same clone as Prince alba, which is located about 1 mile to the North.  Also known as NFA.  This SE area of Grand Rapids has a naturalized population of albas.  NFA trees appear more yellow and the form is less crooked.  Forced flowers of both NFA and Prince and earlier notes (1993?) indicate flowering differences.  NFA flowers have more red, are bigger (fatter) and Prince flowers are longer, darker and not as thick. However, both clones seem to shed pollen indoors if they are close to their natural shed date.  On 2-10-01: This clone was the top performer in a 1992 trial at ISU with 3 trees, 100% survival.  It measured 17.1 DBH in 2007 with 10.79 t/ac/yr.  On 3/29/10 I visited this tree (GR ortet) and compared male stamen development to Prince.  While the color was the same (pink), NFA appeared to be a bit behind Prince.  In Spring of 2010, the Prince clone was just starting to shed pollen and NFA should be starting in 2-3 days.  |M|0|NFA|0|347 Fox St. SW (W of Buchannan, N of Burton) GR, MI.|0|0|W|Y|N|N|Y|2|1993-01-01|A|3|2|0|TBD

Started male branches in 1989 from Canada, which were young (10 yrs?) sparsely flowered.  It shed very little pollen and but did not make seed.

Planted 7 cuttings, 6 survived with the tallest at 8.5'.  3 others were around 8'.  A 1-0 stock of this clone also outperformed nearby clones but not to the same degree. It should be noted that additional fertilizer was applied 2' from the cuttings to ensure survival of the only 41AA111 cutting.  Therefore this clone needs to be reassessed again.  Dormant syliptic cuttings were propagated under lights on 3/24/11.  There were shoots forming from the callus.  On 4/18/11 larger 8cm cuttings were propagated with buds cut off and significant amount of callus and shoots have formed.  |U|0|0|A204|Ortet selected in 2009 @ Bell Nursery|0|0|M|Y|N|N|N|-1|2009-01-01|A|3|140|0|TBD

41AA111|138|Fastigate tree. This and aa4102 are last surviving trees of this clone planted at RNE (~70 planted). It was declining in vigor.  The flowers were very high, so it was cut down in Spring 2010 for Phase 3 breeding.  The stems had a curly habit.  Tree was cut at about 4.5' high to promote shoots for propagation.  It was mated with 3 albas, NFA, EBL, and 35AA201. It had large flowers with thick stigmas.  I fertilized it when the flowers were 1/2 long but might   have been better to wait until about 3/4 long since the stigmas seemed to peak then.

33AA11|139|Nice, well formed tree. Flowers were receptive later (2010)  than other albas, which is why it was selected for NFA, since the Zoss alba pollen failed.  Flower lengths ranged from 1/2 to 3/4 at the time of the NFA fertilization.  On 4/13 I observed how unusual these seed bearing catkins were with large, bright green flowers that point upwards.

80AA3MF|182|Selected by Brad Bender at MSU's FBIC site for notable diameter.  He propagated it via harvesting 120 watersprout shoots at 4' and sticking them in soil mix for several weeks. column 9 and row 5 on the u07m map, it is also in block I. It is the 1st tree in that 4 tree plot. The plot has trees on all sides except the tree in column9 row 4, the space next to this tree where I made the cuttings. It is interesting that the few shoots that I left alone on that tree have all died. This may have been a one time opportunity to get 120 easy greenwood cuttings from the lower branches that are already senescencing  like this.
