# 24dev-demo Digital Portfolio
An unofficial OSGeo addon to demonstrate software and showcase your Digital Portfolio 
via github.com.

This software is intended to provide users with an easy way to develop, test drive and
share applications alongside OSGeo and the open source community. Developers, students
and prospective employers should benefit by viewing the code on github and running the 
applications on OSGeo.  The "24dev" name is a play on words for: "Two For DEVelopment",
via the Open Source Community (OSC) and you, the Open Source Developer (OSD). 

## Both OSC and OSD users can leverage the following features
* Users can install 24dev applications to a live OSGeo DVD or flash drive by running one script.
* Users can rename the base directory and re-run the install script to update profiles.   
* The install script also creates a backup tar file and tests for command success.
* OSD user scripts can display custom license/release files for each application.  
* OSD users are encouraged to fork new releases via github renamed as: 24dev-[myForkName]. 
* OSD users are encouraged to append their details to the existing but renamed license/release files. 

## To install 24dev-demo to an OSGeo Live DVD system
* Download the latest version of the 24dev-demo tar file and install on a USB flash drive.
* Boot your computer with the OSGeo Live DVD.
* Copy the tar file to the OSGeo Desktop.
* Right click on the tar file and select "Extact Here".
* Navigate to the extracted folder, open a terminal window and run the following command:
*   ./apps/install2Osgeo/bin/install2Osgeo.sh
* The above command will create databases, install and test the required programs.
* The program documentation is located online at:  https://github.com/pmcgover/24dev-demo  

## To create your own 24dev version
* TBD
